A secure neural network model with a secure training/inference scheme is indispensable to many applications. To accomplish such a task usually needs one of the entities (the customer or the service provider) to provide private information (customer''s data or the model) to the other. Without a secure scheme and the mutual trust between the service providers and their customers, it will be an impossible mission. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving deep learning model and a secure training/inference scheme to protect the input, the output, and the model in the application of the neural network. We utilize the innate properties of a deep neural network to design a secure mechanism without using any complicated cryptography component. The security analysis shows our proposed scheme is secure and the experimental results also demonstrate that our method is very efficient and suitable for real applications.'),

Historically, U.S. courts have pointed to the unlikelihood of sanctions for data privacy law violations to justify these orders. EU data privacy law, however, has recently undergone several shifts in favor of tougher rules and significantly increased sanctions. Additionally, EU regulators are now more vigilant and active in enforcing these laws. These developments, combined with the benefits of international judicial respect and the intrinsic value of privacy, mean that U.S. courts should more strongly consider EU data privacy law in discovery deliberations. This Note argues that courts should more heavily weigh the interests of foreign nations and the hardship on foreign litigants when contemplating discovery orders and, when appropriate, order discovery to be conducted through the Hague Evidence Convention rather than by the foreign party.

Since the late 1990s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been enforcing companies'' privacy policies through its authority to police unfair and deceptive trade practices. Despite over fifteen years of FTC enforcement, there is no meaningful body of judicial decisions to show for it. The cases have nearly all resulted in settlement agreements. Nevertheless, companies look to these agreements to guide their privacy practices. Thus, in practice, FTC privacy jurisprudence has become the broadest and most influential regulating force on information privacy in the United States-more so than nearly any privacy statute or any common law tort. In this Article, we contend that the FTC''s privacy jurisprudence is functionally equivalent to a body of common law, and we examine it as such. We explore how and why the FTC, and not contract law, came to dominate the enforcement of privacy policies. A common view of the FTC''s privacy jurisprudence is that it is thin, merely focusing on enforcing privacy promises. In contrast, a deeper look at the principles that emerge from FTC privacy "common law" demonstrates that the FTC''s privacy jurisprudence is quite thick. The FTC has codified certain norms and best practices and has developed some baseline privacy protections. Standards have become so specific they resemble rules. We contend that the foundations exist to develop this "common law" into a robust privacy regulatory regime, one that focuses on consumer expectations of privacy, extends far beyond privacy policies, and involves a full suite of substantive rules that exist independently from a company''s privacy representations.

They include discrimination, reputational harm, and chilling effects on speech, thought, and behavior. However, scholarship has yet to fully recognize a kind of privacy harm that this Article terms "expressive. ". Depending on where the search is taking place and who the actors involved are--a teacher in a school, the police on the street, a food inspector in a restaurant--victims and observers might infer different messages from the search. The search marks the importance of certain societal values such as law enforcement or food safety. It can also send messages about certain groups by signaling the immaturity of children, the ignorance of women who seek abortions, the untrustworthiness and moral inferiority of prisoners, probationers, and parolees, and the danger of those with certain diseases. Conversely, searches emphasize the special social trust held by schools, parents, prison wardens, policemen, and the American public. The Supreme Court has, in many instances, recognized these effects. By applying expressive theories of law to privacy law for the first time, this Article demonstrates how privacy intrusions help modulate and texture the status of groups in society. Furthermore, in the specific case of mass surveillance, expressive intrusions can alter the relative status of citizens and the government. The Article ends by providing a range of remedies, varying from ending the intrusion to (counterintuitively) making the intrusion routine or secret. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Since the New Deal, American law has rested on the wise judgment that, by and large, commercial regulation should be made on the basis of economic and social policy, rather than blunt constitutional rules. This has become one of the basic principles of American constitutional law. Although some observers have suggested that the United States Supreme Court''s recent decision in Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc. changes this state of affairs, such readings are incorrect. Sorrell involved a challenge to a poorly drafted Vermont law that discriminated on the basis of both content and viewpoint. Such a law would have been unconstitutional if it had regulated even unprotected speech. As the Sorrell Court made clear, the real problem with the Vermont law at issue was that it did not regulate enough, unlike the "more coherent policy" of the undoubtedly constitutional federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Data privacy law should thus rarely be thought of as implicating serious constitutional difficulties, and this is a good thing. As we move into the digital age, in which more and more of our society is affected or constituted by data flows, we face a similar threat. If "data" were somehow "speech," virtually every economic law would become clouded by constitutional doubt. Economic or commercial policy affecting data flows--which is to say all economic or social policy--would become almost impossible. This might be a valid policy choice, but it is not one that the First Amendment commands. Any radical suggestions to the contrary are unsupported by our constitutional law. In a democratic society, the basic contours of information policy must ultimately be up to the people and their policy-making representatives, and not to unelected judges. We should decide policy on that basis, rather than on odd readings of the First Amendment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Also for these "late-comer" EU Member States the GDPR granted the option not only to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of GDPR in specific areas but also to modify certain rules of the GDPR itself. The article provides an overview of how these "late-comer" EU Member States have adjusted their domestic data privacy laws in the following core areas of the new EU privacy law regime: (1) domestic legislation; (2) definitions; (3) relevant authority; (4) registration requirements; (5) data protection officers (DPO); (6) collection and processing; (7) data subject rights; (8) data transfer to third counties; (9) security of personal data; (10) data breach notification; (11) enforcement; (12) data processing in employment context; (13) provisions relating to specific processing situations (chapter 9 GDPR); (14) electronic marketing; (15) online privacy; (16) other notable domestic regulations. Finally, the article presents the updated list of EU Member States not having yet implemented domestic data privacy laws. Although the list indicates the current status of the domestic legislative process for each of these EU Member States, it appears safe to say that 2018 will not see these national data privacy laws adjusted to GDPR.

Traditionally, the pressing cyberthreats appear from emailed attachments. Recently, cyberattacks increasingly stealing or compromising data and are the potentials for physical damage to critical infrastructure. The risks of the data breach or compromised data collection are often favored by potential financial benefits (e.g., blackmail, fraud, false information, intellectual property thefts, business competition). That is, an important factor for current and future economical investments is due to the motivation of cybercrime activities. In this paper, we first analyze a question about our effort on security and privacy in terms of economic perspectives. That is, do we need to protect big data in a secure, private, and most effective manner, while the growing amount of security threats, attacks, and data breaches together with the increasing market for security products arises? Secondly, we perform the investigation from several perspectives: the economic perspective of big data security and privacy, investment decisions, fighting cybercrimes through big data, and cyberinsurance for big data. Our objective is to provide economic justification of technical decisions taken to protect the big data and the amount of costs that organizations often spend for it.'),

The widely publicised case centred on a conflict between neighbours in a Wellington hill suburb, with the Walmsleys having built a large fence-like structure to provide for their privacy, but which had the effect of obscuring the Aitchisons'' panoramic views. While a long court process ensued, at heart it was a simple matter that many urban households could relate to: a conflict between competing urban values, of privacy versus views. This conflict illustrates the economic concept of externalities, which arise when one party''s actions harm another party. Despite this harm often seeming to come from only one side, Aitchison v Walmsley shows the reciprocal nature of externalities. That is, externalities arise when two (or more) parties want to use the same scarce resource, but in inconsistent ways. In this case, while one party desires privacy, the other desires views. The question then is how such externality problems can best be resolved. Two principles from the field of law and economics assist in answering this. One, the Coase theorem, shows how externality problems can be resolved by private agreement between the relevant parties. The other, the Hobbes theorem, provides an approach when private agreement breaks down, and an authoritative third party, such as a court or government, is required to determine the outcome. Both approaches provide a strong conceptual foundation for robust legal and economic analysis that can balance conflicting values in a way that best benefits society. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

A key challenge for realizing the vision is, however, “How will the technology system handle user data?” For the user centric and data centric 5G technologies to be accepted and function as a viable business model, user trust in their data privacy is paramount. Today personal data have become an economic asset belonging to the service providers whose business case often includes and is dependent on the use and selling of such data.

In this work, threats on data privacy are modeled considering the particular aspects of privacy attacks. A numerical analysis is conducted to analyze the impact of the quality of detection and reaction to privacy breaches, on optimal investment and residual risk. The analysis shows that the amount of optimal investment depends on the minimal time period to detect a security breach, the ability of the customer firm to react to such an attack as quickly as possible, and also on the type of threat on private data. In particular it has been shown that for threats related to private information theft, the customer firm can take advantage from the delay in detecting attacks at the outsourcing provider side. Moreover, it should not also put a lot of security investment effort in reducing the reaction time to these privacy attacks. In the contrary, for threats related to privacy exploitation by self-propagating malware, the customer firm has not to contact with an outsourcing company which is not committed to report an attack occurrence within a short delay, and should not to put a lot of security investment effort in reducing the reaction time to these attacks.'),

Optimal choice weighs the demand for accurate statistics against the demand for privacy. Examples from US statistical programs show how our framework can guide decision-making.

They provide evidence for the so-called “privacy paradox” which describes that people’s intentions, with regard to privacy, differ from their actual behavior.

The objective of the paper is to shed light on the trade-off between privacy and the business value of customer information. To that end, the authors review approaches to convert clickstream data into behavioral traits, which we call clickstream features, and propose a categorization of these features according to the potential threat they pose to user privacy. The authors then examine the extent to which different categories of clickstream features facilitate predictions of online user shopping patterns and approximate the marginal utility of using more privacy adverse information in behavioral prediction models. Thus, the paper links the literature on user privacy to that on e-commerce analytics and takes a step toward an economic analysis of privacy costs and benefits. In particular, the results of empirical experimentation with large real-world e-commerce data suggest that the inclusion of short-term customer behavior based on session-related information leads to large gains in predictive accuracy and business performance, while storing and aggregating usage behavior over longer horizons has comparably less value.'),

a two-sided economic model that captures the interaction between the users, publisher websites, and third

website and the impact of users’ privacy concerns on third party market concentration. We then analyze
welfare aspects to provide insights on the impacts of industry regulations and policy on users, publisher websites, and third parties.

These regulations that oblige telecom operators and Internet communication services to store the content of communications should come into force on July 1, 2018. The article describes in detail the main components of the data retention mechanism: the triggers for its application, its scope, exemptions and barriers to its enforcement. Attention is paid to specific principles for implementation of content retention requirements based on the concepts of proportionality, reasonableness and effectiveness. Particular consideration is given to the comparative aspects of the Russian data retention legislation and those applying in different countries (mainly EU member states). The article focuses on the differences between the Russian and EU approaches to the question of how to strike a balance between public security interests and privacy. While the EU model of data retention is developing in the context of profound disputes on human rights protection, the Russian model is mostly concentrated on security interests and addresses mainly economic, technological aspects of its implementation. The paper stresses that a range of factors (legal, economic and technological) needs to be taken into account for developing an optimal data retention system. Human rights guarantees play the key role in legitimization of such intrusive measures as data retention. Great attention should be paid to the procedures, precise definitions, specification of entitled authorities and the grounds for access to data, providing legal immunities and privileges, etc. Only this extensive range of legal guarantees can balance intervention effect of state surveillance and justify data retention practices.

This mechanism relies on the use of machine-readable privacypolicies, posted on a website, and interpreted by a client-side browser extension. However, recent surveys indicate that adoption of this technology is stagnating on the server side, and work on an updated version of the Platform has been halted.

The objective of this survey is to provide a consistent view about both data security concerns and privacy issues that are faced by clients in cloud storage environments. This survey brings a critical comparative analysis of cryptographic defense mechanisms, and beyond this, it explores research directions and technology trends to address the protection of outsourced data in cloud infrastructures.'),

However, the sharing economy''s implications for marketing thought and practice remain unclear. This article defines the sharing economy as a technologically enabled socioeconomic system with five key characteristics (i.e., temporary access, transfer of economic value, platform mediation, expanded consumer role, and crowdsourced supply). It also examines the sharing economy''s impact on marketing''s traditional beliefs and practices in terms of how it challenges three key foundations of marketing: institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), processes (e.g., innovation, branding, customer experience, value appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society) and offers future research directions designed to push the boundaries of marketing thought. The article concludes with a set of forward-looking guideposts that highlight the implications of the sharing economy''s paradoxes, maturation, and technological development for marketing research. Collectively, this article aims to help marketing scholars not only keep pace with the sharing economy but also shape its future direction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

It needs to be recognized that existing vehicular communication systems are susceptible to privacy vulnerabilities which require addressing. A practical challenge is that many vehicular communication applications and services make use of basic safety messages that contain the identity of the vehicle, location, and other personal data. A popular way of dealing with this privacy issue is to utilize a pseudonym change scheme to protect the vehicle’s identity and location. However, many such schemes suffer that the cost grows and the certificate management difficulty raises with the number of pseudonyms generated and stored, casting doubt of the economic feasibility of that approach. We propose a decentralized blockchain-based solution for pseudonym management that overcomes these limitations. This scheme consists of pseudonym distribution and a shuffle operation, allowing the reuse of existing pseudonyms to different vehicles. The results reported here, including those from our simulations, demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reuse existing pseudonyms and achieve a better degree of anonymity at a lower cost than existing schemes.'),

Existing research mostly describes data privacy as a necessary evil for compliance and risk management and does not propose specific data privacy measures which address the customers’ concerns. We therefore aim to shed light on the upside of data privacy. In this paper, we derive specific measures to deal with customers’ data privacy concerns based on academic literature, legislative texts, corporate privacy statements, and expert interviews. Next, we leverage the Kano model and data from two internet-based surveys to analyze the measures’ evaluation by customers. From a customer perspective, the implementation of the majority of measures is obligatory as those measures are considered as basic needs of must-be quality. However, delighting measures of attractive quality do exist and have the potential to create a competitive advantage. In this, we find some variation across different industries suggesting that corporations aiming to improve customer satisfaction by superior privacy protection should elicit the demands of their specific target customers.'),

It is an efficient way of dynamic spectrum sharing that enhances accessing opportunities of SUs and escalates revenue of PUs. In the spectrum trading market, bidding privacy is a serious concern for SUs, since untrustworthy PUs or spectrum traders may leverage bidding information to manipulate the trading or leak SU''s bids to other SU competitors for illegal gains. Current centralized privacy preserving spectrum trading designs may incur extra infrastructure deployment, miss many instantaneous spectrum accessing opportunities, and have scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving semidistributed spectrum trading scheme for multiradio multichannel CRNs, which has joint consideration of spectrum reuse, SUs’ bidding privacy preservation, and PUs’ revenue maximization. We use the conflict graph to characterize SUs’ interference relationships, and jointly employ the Paillier Cryptosystem and dynamic matching to conduct the spectrum trading in a semidistributed manner. Through security, complexity and performance analysis, we show that the proposed scheme 1) effectively preserves the privacy of SUs’ bidding values, and 2) notably increases the PUs’ revenue and improves spectrum utilization with limited overhead.

Specifically we consider: do different generations experience information and communication technology-mediated environments in the same way or not? Are there disjunctures or continuities in the experience of privacy across one generation? Do different generations have dissimilar attitudes about what constitutes a privacy invasion and different levels of concern about such invasions? Or is privacy a concern that develops as one ages through her life cycle and becomes more invested in the social and economic world? In other words, is information privacy, instead, something of a middle-age concern? To answer these questions, we first review the literature on generational differences, as well as the literature on privacy attitudes and introduce a number of hypotheses. We then analyze responses to two survey questions that have been asked periodically over the last 30 years to determine whether there are age cohort and/or generational differences. From the data examined, it is difficult to speak with any authority on the question of whether familiarity with technology means that younger generations or age cohorts are less concerned about technology or whether as all generations and age groups become familiar with technology privacy concerns decrease over time. However we do identify some interesting patterns. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

However, as research increasingly bridges the physical and social science domains (e.g., socio‐hydrology), there is the potential for well‐meaning researchers to unintentionally violate the privacy and security of individuals or communities by sharing sensitive information. Here we identify the contexts in which privacy violations are most likely to occur, such as working with high‐resolution spatial data (e.g., from remote sensing), consumer data (e.g., from smart meters), and/or digital trace data (e.g., from social media). We also suggest practices for identifying and addressing privacy concerns at the individual, institutional, and disciplinary levels. We strongly advocate that the water science community continue moving toward open science and socio‐environmental research and that progress toward these goals be rooted in open and ethical data management. Key Points: Natural scientists have little guidance to deal with privacy concerns for open science, which are inherent in socio‐environmental researchHydrology data with potential privacy concerns include high‐resolution spatial data, consumer data, and digital trace dataScientists should continue to share data openly while proactively addressing privacy concerns via ethical data management and sharing [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

But the central assumptions that underlie these special protections, imposed through various la ws on both sides of the Atlantic, have lagged behind modernization and technological advancements. The current scheme of sensitive data protection faces three primary obstacles, which, taken together, show that prioritization of sensitive information is no longer sufficient on its own to deal with the most significant privacy risks to individuals. The first challenge is the rapid growth in data-collecting technologies, which have led to the emergence of new types of data. This new information can range from behavioral data produced by online activity and collected by social networking sites, to geolocation data produced by cell phone and other smart devices that monitor users '' movements and activities. The second challenge, closely related to the first, is that nonidentifiable, non-sensitive types of data can still be linked to an identity or used to reveal or infer sensitive data using innovative analytic techniques. Many datasets that attempt to anonymize or deidentify data -- that is, tools that expunge personally-identifying information such as names, addresses, or dates of birth -- may still be combined with other datasets to re-identify individuals. The third and final obstacle is that the "sensitivity" of a given piece of information can change depending on the context of its use. This means that the sensitivity level of a piece of data is not solely a function of its nature or type, but also of the way in which it is used or the ends for which it is utilized. Thus, privacy and data protection laws that assume sensitivity is a static quality of certain data types are not in sync with the reality of data use. This Article concludes by suggesting ways policymakers can rethink the prioritization of sensitive information and address newlyemerging risks to information privacy. Relying entirely on the sensitivity level of a piece of data to determine the risks associated with it will fall short of adequately protecting data subjects'' privacy. Data controllers and regulators must therefore consider other factors, in addition to the category of data or its sensitivity level, such as whether it can be used in combination with other publicly-available data to uniquely identify a person, the likelihood it can be linked to or reveal sensitive data about a person, and the context of the data use, when determining the risks posed by data processing. Laws also ought to extend protection to newly-emerging types of data that are sensitive in nature, such as web-browsing histories and longitudinal location data. La w and policymakers should ultimately move beyond the category-based regulation of data to effectively protect privacy today.'),

Nowadays, it is intricate to envision the way the machine learning and big data can influence the healthcare industries. It has been observed that most of the authors who implemented the use of machine learning and big data analytics in disease diagnosis have not given significant weightage to the privacy and security of the data. Here, a novel design of smart and secure healthcare information system using machine learning and advanced security mechanism has been proposed to handle big data of medical industry. The innovation lies in the incorporation of optimal storage and data security layer used to maintain security and privacy. Different techniques like masking encryption, activity monitoring, granular access control, dynamic data encryption and end point validation have been incorporated.

The software packages for data analysis have two major shortcomings: (1) solutions are not offered as a service reachable by standard procedures over the Internet, but as isolated standalone applications or ERP system modules; (2) privacy restrictions need to be integrated into a framework of business analytics for Web retailers. The first aspect can be addressed with standardized developer software for Web services, but the second must consider privacy legislation, privacy specifications on Web sites (P3P), and data reidentification problems. These shortcomings are addressed by a proposed formal model of these problems and an implementation of the model as a declarative specification of privacy constraints, expressed as an extension of P3P. The constraints are complemented by a logic identifying the elements in a given set of Web analytics that might lead to data reidentification and therefore violate implicit privacy constraints. A Web-based service is presented that uses these components to automatically adapt the set of available Web analytics to an on-line retailer''s P3P policy.

Many such sites, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter expanded to become “platforms,” meaning they are both websites and distributors of data. These data would typically be distributed to third parties in privacy-sensitive ways and regulated by the platform. Such access is based on balancing three issues: user privacy, generativity (i.e., capacity for novelty) for third parties, and control for platforms. Platforms appear to be seeking progressively more control at the cost of generativity by severely restricting third-party access to data about the user’s friends. The reductions or outright lack of access means that the insights from our digital traces are no longer as knowable to either third parties or users. This article unpacks this shift by clarifying some of the technical issues involved (particularly APIs, the main means of external data access). The case study of social network visualization is used to exemplify how social network sites seek control at the expense of generativity. The article notes how this shift was done with little oversight.'),

Moreover, in addition to the existing models of privacy—the surveillance model and capture model—we need to also consider a new model: the datafication model presented in this article, wherein new personal information is deduced by employing predictive analytics on already-gathered data. These three models of privacy supplement each other; they are not competing understandings of privacy. This broadened approach will take our thinking beyond current preoccupation with whether or not individuals’ consent was secured for data collection to privacy issues arising from the development of new information on individuals'' likely behavior through analysis of already collected data—this new information can violate privacy but does not call for consent.

However, risk of violating privacy of individual respondents and groups of respondents by analyzing primary data has not been reduced. There is a need in developing subtler methods of data protection to come to grips with these challenges. In some cases, individual and group privacy can be easily violated, because the primary data contain attributes that uniquely identify individuals and groups thereof. Removing such attributes from the dataset is a crude solution and does not guarantee complete privacy. In the field of providing individual data anonymity, this problem has been widely recognized, and various methods have been proposed to solve it. In the current work, we demonstrate that it is possible to violate group anonymity as well, even if those attributes that uniquely identify the group are removed. As it turns out, it is possible to use third-party data to build a fuzzy model of a group. Typically, such a model comes in a form of a set of fuzzy rules, which can be used to determine membership grades of respondents in the group with a level of certainty sufficient to violate group anonymity. In the work, we introduce an evolutionary computing based method to build such a model. We also discuss a memetic approach to protecting the data from group anonymity violation in this case.'),

Machine-learning technology is used to create digitally manipulated ''deep fake'' sex videos that swap people''s faces into pornography. Each of these abuses is an invasion of sexual privacy--the behaviors, expectations, and choices that manage access to and information about the human body, sex, sexuality, gender, and intimate activities.

It serves as a cornerstone for sexual autonomy and consent. It is foundational to human dignity and intimacy, and its denial results in the subordination of marginalized communities. Traditional privacy law is increasingly insufficient to protect this interest. Its efficacy is eroding just as digital technologies magnify the scale and scope of the harm. The Article suggests a new approach to protecting sexual privacy that focuses on law and markets.

We show that together they constitute a language that we, as subjects, did not choose yet are increasingly forced to negotiate. Moreover, these mechanisms are both numerous and highly complex and are only one component within large ecosystems of geosurveillance, making privacy ever more evasive.

As such, we highlight the Tor network as an example of resistance to geosurveillance that is enabled by acutely understanding the hypertechnical language that otherwise binds us. Indeed, as we emphasize throughout, mechanism matters'),

They want to keep control over their own data, e.g. through consent and authorization management. This paper proposes a lightweight privacy-preserving solution for managing user’s consent relative to specific purposes (obligations). The originality of our proposal is manyfold. First, the consent is issued cryptographically by the user over some consented specific purposes, thus it protects both the user and the service provider against possible repudiations. Second, the users’ privacy is preserved as the protocol supports untraceability over the channel, and pseudonymity with regard to the service provider. Pseudonyms are fully managed by the users themselves through suitable use of Hierarchical Identity-Based Signature (HIBS). Third, the solution is lightweight in terms of communication and computation, thus making it suitable for IoT resource constrained environments. Fourth, an illustrative car-sharing use case is presented where users are able to personalize their driving experience. Fifth, a formal validation of the protocol is provided with the AVISPA tool, along with an informal security and privacy analysis.

Recently, novel variants of (A)DP focused on giving tighter privacy bounds under continual observation. In this paper we unify many previous works via the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of a mechanism. We show that for non-adaptive mechanisms, the privacy loss under sequential composition undergoes a convolution and will converge to a Gauss distribution (the central limit theorem for DP). We derive several relevant insights: we can now characterize mechanisms by their privacy loss class, i.e., by the Gauss distribution to which their PLD converges, which allows us to give novel ADP bounds for mechanisms based on their privacy loss class; we derive exact analytical guarantees for the approximate randomized response mechanism and an exact analytical and closed formula for the Gauss mechanism, that, given ε, calculates δ, s.t., the mechanism is (ε, δ)-ADP (not an over-approximating bound).'),

To respond to the public''s demand for data privacy, a class of clustering-based data masking techniques is increasingly being used for privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics. Although they address reidentification risks, traditional clustering-based approaches for masking numeric attributes typically do not consider the disclosure risk of categorical confidential attributes. We propose a new approach to deal with this problem. The proposed method clusters data such that the data points within a group are similar in the nonconfidential attribute values, whereas the confidential attribute values within a group are well distributed. To accomplish this, the clustering method, which is based on a minimum spanning tree (MST) technique, uses two risk-utility trade-off measures in the growing and pruning stages of the MST technique, respectively. As part of our approach we also propose a novel cluster-level microperturbation method for masking data that overcomes a common problem of traditional clustering-based methods for data masking, which is their inability to preserve important statistical properties such as the variance of attributes and the covariance across attributes. We show that the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the masked data generated using the microperturbation method are unbiased estimates of the original mean vector and covariance matrix. An experimental study on several real-world data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.'),

This has become more important following revelations made by Edward Snowden in 2013 regarding the collection of vast swathes of data from the Internet by signals intelligence agencies such as NSA and GCHQ. The nature of this collection is such that if the control account is correct then there has been a significant invasion of people''s privacy. If, though, the access account is correct then there has not been an invasion of privacy on the scale suggested by the control account. I argue that the control account of privacy is mistaken. However, the consequences of this are not that the seizing control of personal information is unproblematic. I argue that the control account, while mistaken, seems plausible for two reasons. The first is that a loss of control over my information entails harm to the rights and interests that privacy protects. The second is that a loss of control over my information increases the risk that my information will be accessed and that my privacy will be violated. Seizing control of another''s information is therefore harmful, even though it may not entail a violation of privacy.

It is widely acknowledged that there is great potential for utilising these routine data for health research to derive new knowledge about health, disease, and treatments. However, the reuse of routine healthcare data for research is not beyond debate. In this paper, we discuss three issues that have stirred considerable controversy among health data scientists. First, we discuss van der Lei’s 1st Law of Medical Informatics, which states that data shall be used only for the purpose for which they were collected. Then, we discuss to which extent routine data sources and innovations in analytical methods alleviate the need to conduct randomised clinical trials. Finally, we address questions of governance, privacy, and trust when routine health data are made available for research. While we don’t think that there is a definite “right answer” for any of these issues, we argue that data scientists should be aware of the arguments for different viewpoints, respect their validity, and contribute constructively to the debate. The three controversies discussed in this paper relate to core challenges for research with health data and define an essential research agenda for the health data science community.'),

These advancement leads to the concern of exploitation of users’ personal information due to non-restricted usage of data by any third party applications. Mobile crowdsourcing has evolved as an appropriate method for collecting the data or finding solution of a broadcasted task where the mobile phone users can perform the task anytime and anywhere as they wish. However, sensitive information like location, contact details etc. are provided by mobile users for validation which may results in the privacy breach as the data could be misused. There have been many researches to find some tools for ensuring privacy of the mobile phone users. However, the appropriateness of these tools may not be identified by the users which require additional protection of the data to maintain the confidentiality. The motive of this research is to provide secure environment for the users or workers of crowd sourcing by protecting their personal and sensitive information. Therefore, SALT cryptography is used in proposed solution for ensuring the privacy. SALT is used as a noise with the user’s personal information so that only the valid users will be able to access the information.

In each iteration of the search in such algorithms, every agent selects a group of agents that comply with some selection criteria (each algorithm specifies different criteria). Then, the agent who selected the group, called the mediator, collects assignment information from the group and neighboring agents outside the group, in order to find an optimal set of assignments for its group''s agents. A contest between mediators of adjacent groups determines which groups will replace their assignments in that iteration to the found optimal ones. In this work we present a framework called RODA (Region Optimal DCOP Algorithm) that encompasses the algorithms in the region optimality family, and in particular any method for selecting groups. We devise a secure implementation of RODA, called P-RODA, which preserves constraint privacy and partial decision privacy. Our discussion covers both symmetric and asymmetric DCOPs. The two main cryptographic means that enable this privacy preservation are secret sharing and homomorphic encryption. We estimate the computational overhead of P-RODA with respect to RODA and give an upper bound that depends on the group and domain sizes and on the graph topology, but not on the number of agents. The estimations are substantiated with experimental results, including experiments on a simulator, that compare the performance of P-RODA to that of its competing algorithm, P-Max-Sum.'),

One important property of the Fog Computing is location awareness. To guarantee this property in a practical hostile environment, location verification protocols are always desired. However, few location verification protocols can protect the location privacy of the location prover, who attempts to prove that he or she is at some position or in some region. Even worse, to the best of our knowledge, no location verification protocol has considered how to protect the location privacy against the verifiers of the protocol, who verify whether the prover is telling the truth.In this paper, we solve this problem by giving constructions of secure positioning protocol with location privacy in the bounded retrieval model. More precisely, we first explore how to define location privacy, which requires that nearly all parties except the prover, including verifiers and outside attackers, cannot learn any additional information about the exact position of the prover, for secure positioning protocol in the bounded retrieval model. Then we illustrate how to construct protocols satisfying this definition. In particular, we present a construction in the one-dimension setting, which explains the basic idea of our construction, and a construction in the three-dimensions setting, which can capture most practical scenarios. Amazingly, privacy is achieved without introducing additional computation overhead, and our system is as efficient as the one constructed in Chandran et al. (CRYPTO 2009). Besides, based on our proposed secure positioning protocols with location privacy, we also build more advanced cryptographic protocols exploiting location verification, e.g., position based key exchange, position based multi-party computation, position based public key infrastructure, etc., all of which still preserve the location privacy. Finally, we also give a proof of concept implementation of our system, which demonstrates that our system is quite practical in practice.'),

Because, the privacy of the sensitive data should be safeguard from the unauthorized access for improving its security. So, various key generation, encryption and decryption mechanisms are developed in the traditional works for privacy preservation in cloud. Still, it remains with the issues such as increased computational complexity, time consumption, and reduced security. Also, the traditional works use the symmetric key cryptography based. Thus, this paper aims to develop a new privacy preservation mechanism by implementing a fully homomorphic–elliptic curve cryptography (FH-ECC) algorithm. The data owner encrypts the original data by converting it into the cipher format with the use of ECC algorithm, and applies the FH operations on the encrypted data before storing it on the cloud. When the user gives the data request to the cloud, the Cloud Service Provider verifies the access control policy of the user for enabling the restricted access on the data. If the access policy is verified, the encrypted data is provided to the user, from that the cipher text is extracted. Then, the ECC decryption and FH operations are applied to generate the original text. Based on the several analysis, the research work is evaluated with the help of different performance measures such as execution time, encryption time, and decryption time. In addition the effectiveness of the novel FHE technique is justified by the comparative analysis made with the traditional techniques.'),

In this paper, we address the problem of privacy-preservation in decentralized optimization. In most existing decentralized optimization approaches, participating agents exchange and disclose intermediate estimate values to neighboring agents explicitly, which may not be desirable when the estimates contain sensitive information of individual agents. The problem is more acute when adversaries exist which try to steal information from other participating agents. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that enables privacy-preservation in decentralized optimization by combining partially homomorphic cryptography with the unique properties of the decentralized optimization. We show that cryptographic techniques can be incorporated in a fully decentralized manner to enable privacy-preservation in decentralized optimization in the absence of any third party or aggregator. This is significant in that to our knowledge, all existing cryptographic-based optimization approaches rely on the assistance of a third-party or aggregator in order to protect the privacy of all parties. The approach is also applicable to the average consensus problem, which is finding broad applications in fields as diverse as robotic networks, distributed computing, and power systems. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness and low computational complexity of the proposed approach.'),

Preventing privacy disclosure and providing useful information to legitimate users for data mining are conflicting goals. Generalization and randomized response methods were proposed in database community to tackle this problem. However, both of them have postulated the same prior belief for all transactions, which might be wrong modeling and lead to privacy breach. Besides, generalization and randomized response methods usually require a privacy controlling parameter to control the tradeoff between privacy and data quality, which may put the data publishers in a dilemma. In this paper, a novel privacy preserving method for data publication is proposed based on conditional probability distribution and machine learning techniques, which can achieve different prior beliefs for different transactions. A basic cross sampling algorithm and a complete cross sampling algorithm are designed respectively for the settings of single sensitive attribute and multiple sensitive attributes, and an improved complete algorithm is developed by using Gibbs sampling, in order to enhance data utility when data are not sufficient. Our method can offer stronger privacy guarantee, while, as shown in the extensive experiments, retaining better data utility.'),

In the today’s scenario, the number of online song repositories such as iTunes, Hungama.com, etc. is increasing day-by-day. The reason for this can be attributed to the exponential growth in the Internet users in the past few years. These song repositories store huge number of songs (mostly in millions) and charge their users for listening and downloading them. With increased number of users requires more enhanced security measures to protect such vulnerable songs repository. Any breach in security of such song repositories would not only cause huge financial loss but also copyright infringement for the owners. Therefore, in this paper we have presented a novel and efficient approach for providing security and privacy to huge and vulnerable songs repository using visual cryptography. Presented approach not only provides confidentiality to the songs but also provides integrity verification with access control to the songs repository. We have also removed various basic security constraints of (2, 2) visual cryptography existed in most of the state of art approaches like meaningless pattern of the shares, explicit codebook requirement, contrast loss, lossy recovery etc which are eliminated in the proposed approach.'),

In this direction, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides seamless services with reduced latency, enhanced mobility, and improved location awareness. Since MEC has evolved from Cloud Computing, it inherited numerous security and privacy issues from the latter. Further, decentralized architectures and diversified deployment environments used in MEC platforms also aggravate the problem; causing great concerns for the research fraternity. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient and lightweight mutual authentication protocol for MEC environments; based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), one-way hash functions and concatenation operations. The designed protocol also leverages the advantages of discrete logarithm problems, computational Diffie-Hellman, random numbers and time-stamps to resist various attacks namely-impersonation attacks, replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, etc. The paper also presents a comparative assessment of the proposed scheme relative to the current state-of-the-art schemes. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed scheme incurs relatively less communication and computational overheads, and is appropriate to be adopted in resource constraint MEC environments.'),

In LDP, each user perturbs her information locally, and only sends the randomized version to an aggregator who performs analyses, which protects both the users and the aggregator against private information leaks. Although LDP has attracted much research attention in recent years, the majority of existing work focuses on applying LDP to complex data and/or analysis tasks. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental problem of collecting multidimensional data under LDP has not been addressed sufficiently, and there remains much room for improvement even for basic tasks such as computing the mean value over a single numeric attribute under LDP. Motivated by this, we first propose novel LDP mechanisms for collecting a numeric attribute, whose accuracy is at least no worse (and usually better) than existing solutions in terms of worst-case noise variance. Then, we extend these mechanisms to multidimensional data that can contain both numeric and categorical attributes, where our mechanisms always outperform existing solutions regarding worst-case noise variance. As a case study, we apply our solutions to build an LDP-compliant stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD), which powers many important machine learning tasks. Experiments using real datasets confirm the effectiveness of our methods, and their advantages over existing solutions.'),

Applying certificateless cryptography to cloud auditing has shown many merits. However, in a multi-user setting, certificateless cloud auditing (CLCA) schemes require additional security requirements. For instance, the identity privacy becomes an important issue that should be taken into consideration in some applications. In this paper, we concentrate on the identity privacy of CLCA schemes. We define the security models of privacy-preserving CLCA schemes, namely the uncheatability and anonymity and propose an efficient CLCA scheme, which is secure in the security models. As a feature of our scheme, the tag of a message is compact, which consists of only one group element. The uncheatability is based on variants of bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. The identity privacy of the user is information-theoretically guaranteed against the third party auditor.'),

Yet, this paradigm continuously suffers from numerous security and privacy concerns mainly due to its massive scale, distributed nature, and scarcity of resources towards the edge of IoT networks. Interestingly, blockchain based techniques offer strong countermeasures to protect data from tampering while supporting the distributed nature of the IoT. However, the enormous amount of energy consumption required to verify each block of data make it difficult to use with resource-constrained IoT devices and with real-time IoT applications. Nevertheless, it can expose the privacy of the stakeholders due to its public ledger system even though it secures data from alterations. Edge computing approaches suggest a potential alternative to centralized processing in order to populate real-time applications at the edge and to reduce privacy concerns associated with cloud computing. Hence, this paper suggests the novel privacy preserving blockchain called TrustChain which combines the power of blockchains with trust concepts to eliminate issues associated with traditional blockchain architectures. This work investigates how TrustChain can be deployed in the edge computing environment with different levels of absorptions to eliminate delays and privacy concerns associated with centralized processing and to preserve the resources in IoT networks.'),

It is a challenging concern in data collecting, publishing, and mining when personal information is controlled by untrustworthy cloud services with unpredictable risks for privacy leakages. In this paper, we formulate an information-theoretic model for privacy protection and present a concrete solution to theoretical architecture in privacy computing from the perspectives of quantification and optimization. Thereinto, metrics of privacy and utility for randomized response (RR) which satisfy differential privacy are derived as average mutual information and average distortion rate under the information-theoretic model. Finally, a discrete multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is proposed to search optimal RR distorted matrices. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach is the first solution to optimize RR distorted matrices using discrete MOPSO. In detail, particles’ position and velocity are redefined in the problem-guided initialization and velocity updating mechanism. Two mutation strategies are introduced to escape from local optimum. The experimental results illustrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art works and can contribute optimal Pareto solutions of extensive RR schemes to future study.'),

Source-location privacy protection is an important research topic. Many schemes have been designed based on different adversarial models. In this paper, a scheme named Source-location Privacy Full Protection (SPFP) is proposed. We consider a more practical adversarial model — a smart adversary — which is a combination of global and local models. To defend against the new adversary, first, we design a lightweight message sharing scheme that is based on congruence equations. Second, each message is mapped to a set of shares. The short lengths of the shares enable them to be processed and transmitted in an energy-efficient manner. The correctness and security of the scheme are proved in theorems. In addition, the proposed message sharing scheme can tolerate the unreliability of the sensor nodes and provides a more reliable data transmission mechanism for networks. Third, the source node constructs a cloud around itself based on the shares and dummy packages to hide its location. The radio actions of the nodes in the cloud are carefully arranged to conceal the real shares from the adversaries and render the nodes in the cloud statistically indistinguishable. Last, a random routing algorithm is seamlessly integrated into our scheme to deliver the real shares from the fake source nodes to the sink node, where the original message is reconstructed based on the received shares. The simulation results illustrate that our scheme can provide adequate protection of source-location privacy with a slight increase in energy consumption.'),

Security analysis shows that EPDAS is secure and can provide confidentiality, anonymous authentication, autonomy, integrity, and fault tolerance.

However, database-driven cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are vulnerable to a series of security attacks and privacy threats, especially the privacy breach of secondary users (SUs). In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving protocol to protect the identity and trajectory privacy of each SU and to prevent the database (DB) from tracing any SU. Besides, this paper also aims at improving the efficiency of authentication and channel allocation to offer the best connectivity to SUs wherever they are and at any time. Taking advantage of the elliptic curve cryptography technique, our protocol achieves the mutual authentication between SUs and base stations (BSs), which enhances the security of CRNs communication. Based on channel pre-allocation to BSs, our protocol reduces the latency of obtaining available channels for SUs. Moreover, our protocol exploits reputation to motivate SUs to be honest and thus increases the utilization of the limited spectrum resources. The results of security analysis show that our protocol provides strong privacy preservation for SUs that the DB cannot get the entire trajectory of any SU, even the DB colludes with all BSs. Furthermore, the results also show that the proposed protocol can resist various types of attacks. The results of performance evaluation indicate the efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving protocol.'),

However, recent advances in electronic healthcare systems allow transmission of sensitive information through the Internet, which is prone to various vulnerabilities, attacks and may leads to unauthorized disclosure. Such situations may not only create adverse effects for individuals but may also cause severe consequences such as hefty regulatory fines, bad publicity, legal fees, and forensics. To avoid such predicaments, a privacy protected healthcare system is proposed in this study that protects the identity of an individual as well as detects vocal fold disorders. The privacy of the developed healthcare system is based on the proposed zero-watermarking algorithm, which embeds a watermark in a secret key instead of the signals to avoid the distortion in an audio sample. The identity is protected by the generation of its secret shares through visual cryptography. The generated shares are embedded by finding the patterns into the audio with the application of one-dimensional local binary pattern. The proposed zero-watermarking algorithm is evaluated by using audio samples taken from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary voice disorder database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves imperceptibility and is reliable in its extraction of identity. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not affect the results of disorder detection and it is robust against noise attacks of various signal-to-noise ratios.'),

In this work, we construct an efficient privacy-aware authentication scheme for MCC services using elliptic curve cryptography. As a result, due to the fact that no bilinear pairings and mapto- point hash operations are involved in the execution, the proposed scheme has much better computation and communication efficiencies than existing related schemes. Detailed performance analysis shows that the computation and the communication costs of our scheme are about 17.44 and 10.64% less than that of the most effective related schemes. Besides, the security analysis shows that our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model.'),

The privacy of the sensitive information ought to be protecting from the unauthorized access for enhancing its security. Security is provided using traditional encryption and decryption process. One of the drawbacks of the traditional algorithm is that it has increased computational complexity, time consumption, and reduced security. The authors have proposed a scheme where the original data gets encrypted into two different values. Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Homomorphic are combined to provide encryption. The data in each slice can be encrypted by using different cryptographic algorithms and encryption key before storing them in the cloud. The objective of this technique is to store data in a proper secure and safe manner in order to avoid intrusions and data attacks meanwhile it will reduce the cost and time to store the encrypted data in the Cloud Storage.

For efficient access and supporting mobility for both the healthcare professionals as well as the patients, the EMR needs to be kept in big data storage in the healthcare cloud. In spite of the popularity of the healthcare cloud, it faces different security issues; for instance, data theft attacks are considered to be one of the most serious security breaches of healthcare data in the cloud. In this paper, the main focus has been given to secure healthcare private data in the cloud using a fog computing facility.

How to ensure that sensitive or critical information is only available to legal users becomes a challenging issue. Two‐factor authentication combining password and smart card perfectly matches this requirement because of its practicality.

Unfortunately, this paper proves that the authentication protocols of Kumari et al. and Nikooghadam et al. have neither the ability to preserve perfect forward secrecy nor the ability to resist key-compromise impersonation attack. In order to remedy such flaws in their protocols, we design a lightweight authentication protocol using elliptic curve cryptography.

Similarly, it is also important to examine social norms and normative expectations with respect to the evolving scientific study of privacy. To this end, we argue for a rigorous analysis of the mapping from normative to technical concepts of privacy and vice versa. We review the landscape of normative and technical definitions of privacy and discuss specific examples of gaps between definitions that are relevant in the context of privacy in statistical computation.

However, it is widely observed that data mining may pose a privacy threat to individual''s sensitive information. To address privacy problem in distributed association rule mining (a data mining technique), we propose two protocols, which are securely generating global association rules in horizontally distributed databases. The first protocol uses the notion of Elliptic-curve-based Paillier cryptosystem, which helps in achieving the integrity and authenticity of the messages exchanged among involving sites over the insecure communication channel. It offers privacy of individual site''s information against the involving sites and an external adversary. However, the collusion of two sites may affect the privacy of individuals. To address this problem, we incorporate Shamir''s secret sharing scheme in the second protocol. It provides privacy by preventing colluding sites and external adversary attack. We analyse both protocols in terms of fulfilling the privacy-preserving distributed association rule mining requirements.'),

In distributed or multiparty computations, optimization theory methods offer appealing privacy properties compared to cryptography and differential privacy methods. However, unlike cryptography and differential privacy, optimization methods currently lack a formal quantification of the privacy they can provide. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a quantification of the privacy of a broad class of optimization approaches. The optimization procedures generate a problem’s data ambiguity for an adversarial observer, which thus observes the problem’s data within an uncertainty set. We formally define a one-to-many relation between a given adversarial observed message and an uncertainty set of the problem’s data. Based on the uncertainty set, a privacy measure is then formalized. The properties of the proposed privacy measure are analyzed. The key ideas are illustrated with examples, including localization and average consensus.'),

Since kernel method has been used widely in object classifiers, we proposed a cryptographic algorithm for the kernel method to process encrypted images without decrypting them. So the owner of these images can have them processed by some classifiers belong to other people without leaking the content of these images to these people, and the owner also learns nothing about the classifier.

Along with the speed, efficiency, and cost-saving benefits of the digital revolution come new challenges to the security and privacy of communications and information traversing the global communications infrastructure. As is with any technology the misuse of technology is noticed similarly the encryption technology. Encryption and other advanced technologies may be used, with direct impact on law enforcement and therefore some restrictions are necessary in the interests of national security. The problem, however, is ensuring that the restriction is legitimate and solely for in the interests of national security, the state not being allowed to interfere and keep a track on individuals'' activities and private lives without sufficient cause. The individual needs encryption to protect their personal privacy and confidential data such as medical information, personal financial data, and electronic mail. In a networked environment, such information is increasingly at risk of being stolen or misused. Therefore, encryption is critical to building a secure and trusted global information infrastructure. Digital computers have changed the landscape considerably and the entire issue, at its simplest level, boils down to a form of balancing of interests. The specific legal and rights-related problems arising from the issue of cryptography and privacy in the Indian context are examined in this paper.'),

As the volume, accuracy and precision of digital geographic information have increased, concerns regarding individual privacy and confidentiality have come to the forefront. Not only do these challenge a basic tenet underlying the advancement of science by posing substantial obstacles to the sharing of data to validate research results, but they are obstacles to conducting certain research projects in the first place. Geospatial cryptography involves the specification, design, implementation and application of cryptographic techniques to address privacy, confidentiality and security concerns for geographically referenced data. This article defines geospatial cryptography and demonstrates its application in cancer control and surveillance. Four use cases are considered: (1) national‐level de‐duplication among state or province‐based cancer registries; (2) sharing of confidential data across cancer registries to support case aggregation across administrative geographies; (3) secure data linkage; and (4) cancer cluster investigation and surveillance. A secure multi-party system for geospatial cryptography is developed. Solutions under geospatial cryptography are presented and computation time is calculated. As services provided by cancer registries to the research community, de-duplication, case aggregation across administrative geographies and secure data linkage are often time-consuming and in some instances precluded by confidentiality and security concerns. Geospatial cryptography provides secure solutions that hold significant promise for addressing these concerns and for accelerating the pace of research with human subjects data residing in our nation’s cancer registries. Pursuit of the research directions posed herein conceivably would lead to a geospatially encrypted geographic information system (GEGIS) designed specifically to promote the sharing and spatial analysis of confidential data. Geospatial cryptography holds substantial promise for accelerating the pace of research with spatially referenced human subjects data.'),

So preserving the privacy of the patient information is an essential feature in e-health systems. In this paper, we first explore the security limitations of the existing authentication schemes. Most of the schemes fail to provide privacy of the credentials of users when session ephemeral secrets are revealed to an adversary. To address the drawbacks found in the existing schemes, we propose a privacy preserving device authentication scheme for wireless body area networks. This proposed scheme provides robust security even if ephemeral secrets are revealed to the adversary. Additionally the proposed scheme avoids the management of large number of public-keys of application providers by the client device. Using Java Pairing-Based Cryptography Library (JPBC), we performed simulations to show that our proposed scheme provides reduced computational overhead for both the client device and the application provider.'),

To preserve data privacy, a node may add a random noise to its original data for information exchange at each iteration. Nevertheless, an eavesdropping node can estimate other''s original data based on the information it received. The estimation accuracy and data privacy can be measured in terms of $(\epsilon,\delta)$-data-privacy, defined as the probability of $\epsilon$-accurate estimate (the difference of an estimation and the original data is within $\epsilon$) is no larger than $\delta$ (the disclosure probability). How to optimize the estimation and analyze data privacy is a critical and open issue. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed to investigate how to optimize the estimation of neighbor''s original data using the local information received, named optimal distributed estimation. Then, we study the disclosure probability under the optimal estimation for data privacy analysis. We further apply the developed framework to analyze the data privacy of the privacy-preserving average consensus algorithm and identify the optimal noises for the algorithm.'''),

For example, passports are no more pure paper documents. Instead, they contain a chip that stores additional information such as pictures and fingerprints of their holder. In order to ensure privacy, these chips include a mechanism, i.e. a cryptographic protocol, that does not let the passport disclose private information to external users except the intended terminal. This is just a single example but of course privacy appears in many other contexts such as RFIDs technologies or electronic voting. \par ``Formal methods have been successfully applied to automatically analyse traditional protocols and discover their flaws.

The current healthcare sector is facing difficulty in satisfying the growing issues, expenses, and heavy regulation of quality treatment. Surely, electronic medical records (EMRs) and protected health information (PHI) are highly sensitive, personally identifiable information (PII). However, the sharing of EMRs, enhances overall treatment quality. A distributed ledger (blockchain) technology, embedded with privacy and security by architecture, provides a transparent application developing platform. Privacy, security, and lack of confidence among stakeholders are the main downsides of extensive medical collaboration. This study, therefore, utilizes the transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology to establish a collaborative medical decision-making scheme. This study considers the experience, skill, and collaborative success rate of four key stakeholders (patient, cured patient, doctor, and insurance company) in the healthcare domain to propose a local reference-based consortium blockchain scheme, and an associated consensus gathering algorithm, proof-of-familiarity (PoF). Stakeholders create a transparent and tenable medical decision to increase the interoperability among collaborators through PoF. A prototype of PoF is tested with multichain 2.0, a blockchain implementing framework. Moreover, the privacy of identities, EMRs, and decisions are preserved by two-layer storage, encryption, and a timestamp storing mechanism. Finally, superiority over existing schemes is identified to improve personal data (PII) privacy and patient-centric outcomes research (PCOR).'),

To cope with those challenges, we propose a highly efficient secure and privacy-preserving scheme based on identity-based aggregate signatures. Our scheme enables hierarchical aggregation and batch verification. The individual identity-based signatures generated by different vehicles can be aggregated and verified in a batch. The aggregated signatures can be re-aggregated by a message collector (e.g., traffic management authority). With our hierarchical aggregation technique, we significantly reduce the transmission/storage overhead of the vehicles and other parties. Furthermore, existing batch verification based schemes in vehicular {\it ad hoc} networks require vehicles to wait for enough messages to perform a batch verification. In contrast, we assume that vehicles will generate messages (and the corresponding signatures) in certain time spans, so that vehicles only need to wait for a very short period before they can start the batch verification procedure. Simulation shows that a vehicle can verify the received messages with very low latency and fast response.'),

However, due to the nature of surveillance, privacy-sensitive information such as face, gait, and other physical parameters based on the captured media from multiple sensors, can be revealed without the permission of the people who appear in the surveillance video. This is a major concern in recent days. Therefore, it is desirable to have such mechanism that can hide privacy-sensitive information as much as possible, yet supporting effective surveillance tasks. In this article, we propose a chaos cryptography based data scrambling approach that can be applied on selected regions of interest (ROIs) in video camera footage, which contains privacy-sensitive data. Our approach also supports multiple levels of abstraction of data hiding depending on the role of the authorized user. In order to evaluate the suitability of this approach, we applied our algorithm on some video camera footage and observed that our approach is computationally efficient and, hence, it can be applied for real-time video surveillance tasks in preserving privacy sensitive information.'),

In this paper, we propose a novel radio frequency identification (RFID) infrastructure enabling multi-purpose RFID tags realized by the use of privacy preserving public key cryptography (PKC) architecture. The infrastructure ensures that the access rights of the tags are preserved based on the spatial and temporal information collected from the RFID readers. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure with respect to cryptanalytic, impersonation, tracking, replay, and relay attacks. We also analyze the feasibility of PKC implementation on passive class 2 RFID tags, and show that the requirements for PKC are comparable to those of other cryptographic implementations based on symmetric ciphers. Our numerical results indicate PKC based systems can outperform symmetric cipher based systems, since the back end servers can identify RFID tags with PKC based systems approximately 57 times faster than the best symmetric cipher based systems.'),

In this research, we propose a cloud-based data storage and processing model with the ability to preserve user privacy and confidentiality of smart meter data in a smart grid. This goal is achieved by encrypting smart meter data before storage on the cloud using a homomorphic asymmetric key cryptosystem. By applying the homomorphic feature of the cryptographic technique, we propose methods to allow most of the computing works of calculating customer invoices based on total electricity consumption to be done directly on encrypted data by the cloud. One of the outstanding features in our model is the aggregation of encrypted smart meter readings using fixed-point number arithmetic. To test the feasibility of our model, we conducted many experiments to estimate the number of homomorphic additions to be performed by the cloud and the computation time in different billing periods using data from the Smart project, in which smart grid readings were continuously collected from different households in every second within two months and electricity usage data collected every minute from 400 anonymous houses in one day. We also propose a parallel version of our billing algorithm to utilize the processing capability of multi-core processors in cloud servers so that computation time is reduced significantly compared to using our sequential algorithm. Our research works and experiments demonstrate clearly how cloud services can strengthen the security, privacy and efficiency of privacy-sensitive data frequently exchanged and processed in an Internet of things where smart meters communicate directly with public networks.'),

Professional sport in the United States has widely adopted biometric technologies, dramatically expanding the monitoring of players’ biodata. These technologies have the potential to prevent injuries, improve performance, and extend athletes’ careers; they also risk compromising players’ privacy and autonomy, the confidentiality of their data, and their careers. The use of these technologies in professional sport and the consumer sector remains largely unregulated and unexamined. We seek to provide guidance for their adoption by examining five areas of concern: (1) validity and interpretation of data; (2) increased surveillance and threats to privacy; (3) risks to confidentiality and concerns regarding data security; (4) conflicts of interest; and (5) coercion. Our analysis uses professional sport as a case study; however, these concerns extend to other domains where their use is expanding, including the consumer sector, collegiate and high school sport, the military, and commercial sectors where monitoring employees is viewed as useful for safety or to maximize labor potential.'),

Objective:To examine the moderating effect of parents’ approach to sharing information with children on the outcomes of information-sharing aboutin vitrofertilisation (IVF) conception.Background:Mental health professionals encourage parents to share information about IVF conception with their children, but limited research is available on associations among information-sharing, parent–child relationship quality and child adjustment. Predictions based on Communication Privacy Management Theory suggest that how parents share private information with children will moderate the association between sharing information about a child’s IVF conception and parent–child relationship quality and indirectly affect child adjustment.Method:Study hypotheses were tested using a sample of 175 families with 246 6- to 12-year-old children conceived using IVF. Path models hypothesised associations among information-sharing, parent privacy orientation, parent–child relationship satisfaction and child behavioural and emotional adjustment.Results:The results supported the proposed process. Among parents with an ‘open’ privacy orientation, IVF information-sharing with children positively related to parent–child relationship quality (r= .19,p= .03). This association was negative when parents had a ‘restricted’ privacy orientation (r= –.34,p= .01). In turn, relationship quality affected child adjustment.Conclusion:Children conceived using IVF report wanting to know about their conception method and infertility counsellors often recommend information-sharing. These findings support the need to better understand IVF information-sharing processes, and parents who favour a ‘restricted’ privacy orientation may require additional support to promote open communication with children about their IVF conception.'),

This article reviews international privacy norms governing human genomic biobanks and databases, and how they address issues related to consent, secondary use, de- identification, access, security, and governance. A range of international instruments were identified, varying in substance - e.g., human rights, data protection, research ethics, biobanks, and genetics - and legal character. Some norms detail processes for broad consent, namely, that even where potential participants cannot consent to specific users and uses, they should be given clear information on access policies, procedures, and governance structures. Some also give guidance about the conditions under which secondary use of data and samples without consent is appropriate, e.g., where consent is impracticable. International norms exhibit a confusing range of terminology relating to de-identification. They also continue to rely heavily on consent and anonymity as the basis for privacy protection, though governance is becoming more prominent. It may not be fatal that such a plurality of norms apply to biobanking; what is essential is that governance be built on shared values, our common interest in the success of genomic research, and practical tools that incentivize responsible, global sharing.'),

An EMR data cube is a complex of EMR statistics that are summarized or aggregated by all possible combinations of attributes. Data cubes are widely utilized for efficient big data analysis and also have great potential for EMR analysis. For safe data analysis without privacy breaches, we must consider the privacy preservation characteristics of the EMR data cube. In this paper, we introduce a design for a privacy-preserving EMR data cube and the anonymization methods needed to achieve data privacy. We further focus on changes in efficiency and effectiveness that are caused by the anonymization process for privacy preservation. Thus, we experimentally evaluate various types of privacy-preserving EMR data cubes using several practical metrics and discuss the applicability of each anonymization method with consideration for the EMR analysis environment.Methods: We construct privacy-preserving EMR data cubes from anonymized EMR datasets. A real EMR dataset and demographic dataset are used for the evaluation. There are a large number of anonymization methods to preserve EMR privacy, and the methods are classified into three categories (i.e., global generalization, local generalization, and bucketization) by anonymization rules. According to this classification, three types of privacy-preserving EMR data cubes were constructed for the evaluation. We perform a comparative analysis by measuring the data size, cell overlap, and information loss of the EMR data cubes.Results: Global generalization considerably reduced the size of the EMR data cube and did not cause the data cube cells to overlap, but incurred a large amount of information loss. Local generalization maintained the data size and generated only moderate information loss, but there were cell overlaps that could decrease the search performance. Bucketization did not cause cells to overlap and generated little information loss; however, the method considerably inflated the size of the EMR data cubes.Conclusions: The utility of anonymized EMR data cubes varies widely according to the anonymization method, and the applicability of the anonymization method depends on the features of the EMR analysis environment. The findings help to adopt the optimal anonymization method considering the EMR analysis environment and goal of the EMR analysis.'),

Disease-based biobanks have operated in hospitals and research institutes in China for decades, and China has recently embarked on a plan to establish further biobank networks with the aim of promoting data sharing among the existing biobanks. Although the Chinese Constitution has only recently begun to recognize individual privacy as a distinct and independent constitutional right, biobanking in China has been loosely regulated under a patchwork of sometimes overlapping laws (such as the Interim Measures for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources) and regulatory instruments, as well as and the policies of individual biobanks and networks of biobanks (such as the Shanghai Biobank Network Guidelines). A Draft Ordinance on Human Genetics Resources is currently being developed that will deal in more detail than previous laws with issues such as management measures, legal liability, and punishment for violations. International data sharing will be tightly regulated under this new law, and individual biobanks'' policies such as the Shanghai Guidelines may choose to regulate such sharing even more. In contrast with national regulatory instruments, the Shanghai Guidelines also contain detailed de-identification policies, and explicitly endorse broad consent.'),

Yet, children''s privacy in the digital era cannot be fully understood without examining marketing practices, especially in the context of "big data." As children increasingly consume content on an ever-expanding variety of digital devices, media and advertising industries are creating new ways to track their behaviors and target them with personalized content and marketing messages based on individual profiles. The advent of the so-called Internet of Things, with its ubiquitous sensors, is expanding these data collection and profiling practices. These trends raise serious concerns about digital dossiers that could follow young people into adulthood, affecting their access to education, employment, health care, and financial services. Although US privacy law provides some safeguards for children younger than 13 years old online, adolescents are afforded no such protections. Moreover, scholarship on children and privacy continues to lag behind the changes taking place in global media, advertising, and technology.

Introduction: The increased availability of mobile sensing technologies is creating a paradigm shift for health research by creating new opportunities for measuring and monitoring behavior. For example, researchers can now collect objective information about a participant''s daily activity using wearable devices that have: 1- Global Positioning System (GPS) to capture location; 2- an outwardly facing camera to document environmental and social context; and, 3- an accelerometer to measure activity levels. While these technologies may offer more accurate means of measuring and understanding behavior, they introduce potential privacy and data security risks for participants as well as for bystanders. The aim of this study was to describe potential risks and risk management strategies in studies using visual imaging and location logging (GPS) data collection methods. Methods: Eight Institutional Review Board (IRB) research protocol applications that included visual imaging and/or GPS data collection methods were identified. Each research protocol application and IRB determination letter was analyzed with the a priori themes of identification of risks (e.g., privacy concerns, data security) and risk management strategies (e.g., disclosure, firewalls) associated with each device. Results: Visual imaging was proposed in four of the eights studies. GPS was included in all eights studies. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology was proposed in all but one study to improve analytics. The findings reveal that: 1) IRBs are grappling with how to consider the rights of bystanders who may be imaged by virtue of being near a research participant; 2) IRBs may not be sufficiently aware of potential risks associated with collection of location data should a data breach occur; and, 3) while research plans incorporated consistent descriptions of each device and associated potential risks, IRB determination letters revealed inconsistent perception of potential study risks. Conclusions: This paper sheds light on ethical issues when using visual imaging and location logging technologies in research. We have exposed concerns and presented management strategies. Questions remain as to whether the risk management strategies are effective and, under what circumstances researchers and IRBs should consider location logging as sensitive data. Empirical research is needed to inform guidelines to enhance the ethical design and conduct of research involving visual imaging and location logging.'),

Aim/Purpose: Following the widespread use of social networking applications (SNAs) by children, adolescents, and young adults, this paper sought to examine the usage habits, sharing, and dangers involved from the perspective of the children, adolescents, and young adults. The research question was: What are the usage habits, sharing, drawbacks, and dangers of using SNAs from the perspective of children, adolescents, and young adults? Background: Safety has become a major issue and relates to a range of activities including online privacy, cyberbullying, exposure to violent content, exposure to content that foments exclusion and hatred, contact with strangers online, and coarse language. The present study examined the use of social networking applications (SNAs) by children, adolescents, and young adults, from their point of view. Methodology: This is a mixed-method study; 551 participants from Israel completed questionnaires, and 110 respondents were also interviewed. Contribution: The study sought to examine from their point of view (a) characteristics of SNA usage; (b) the e-safety of SNA; (c) gender differences between age groups; (d) habits of use; (e) hazards and solutions; and (f) sharing with parents and parental control. Findings: Most respondents stated that cyberbullying (such as shaming) happens mainly between members of the group and it is not carried out by strangers. The study found that children''s awareness of the connection between failures of communication in the SNAs and quarrels and disputes was lower than that of adolescents and young adults. It was found that more children than adolescents and young adults believe that monitoring and external control can prevent the dangers inherent in SNAs, and that the awareness of personal responsibility increases with age. The SNAs have intensified the phenomenon of shaming, but the phenomenon is accurately documented in SNAs, unlike in face-to-face communication. Therefore, today more than ever, it is possible and necessary to deal with shaming, both in face-to-face and in SNA communication. Recommendations for Practitioners: Efforts should be made to resolve the issue of shaming among members of the group and to explain the importance of preserving human dignity and privacy. The Internet in general and SNAs in particular are an integral part of children''s and adolescents'' life environment, so it can be said that the SNAs are part of the problem because they augment shaming. But they can also be part of the solution, because interactions are accurately documented, unlike in face-to-face communication, where it is more difficult to examine events, to remember exactly what has been said, to point out cause and effect, etc. Therefore, more than ever before, today it is possible and necessary to deal with shaming both in face-to-face and in the SNA communication, because from the point of view of youngsters, this is their natural environment, which includes smart phones, SNAs, etc. Recommendations for Researchers: The study recommends incorporating in future studies individual case studies and allowing participants to express how they perceive complex e-Safety situations in the use of social networking apps. Impact on Society: Today more than ever, it is possible and necessary to deal with shaming, both in face-to-face and in SNA communication. Future Research: The study was unable to find significant differences between age groups. Further research may shed light on the subject.'),

Inevitable security issues arise as the server needs to be informed of the query location to provide accurate responses. Despite the many advancements in localization security in wireless sensor networks, servers can still be infected with malicious software. It is now possible to ensure queries do not generate any fake responses that may appear real to users. When a fake response is used, there are mechanisms that can be employed so that the user can identify the authenticity of the query. For this reason, this paper proposes Bloom Filter 0 Knowledge (BL0K), which is novel phase privacy method that preserves the framework for location-based service (LBS) and combines a Bloom filter and the Zero knowledge protocol. The usefulness of these methods has been shown for securing private user information. Analysis of the results demonstrated that BL0K performance is decidedly better when compared to the referenced approaches using the privacy entropy metric.'),

The United Nations (UN) Convention (1989) on the Rights of the Child changed the way children are viewed and treated worldwide. The Convention has been affecting governments, civil society and the private sector. ICT driven companies on the internet should not be an exception. According to Livingstone, Carr and Byrne (2015), Internet governance bodies have given little consideration and reflection to children''s rights. In this paper, it is proposed that in order for youth actively participate in an increasingly digital environment; they need to know better their rights to privacy and freedom of expression, among others. Although the understanding of the digital environments principles lies beyond the scope of average children''s school curricula, they can however play and discover simple technological concepts in the classroom. Thus, by early developing their literacy on digital identity management, they will be able to navigate, communicate, play and learn online more safely, achieving a responsible connected presence. A qualitative study on a visually oriented encrypted learning activity (game) among a group of students aged 16-18 years old, of the third cycle of Basic Vocational Education has been conducted with the following aims: a) to understand how knowledge about security technological processes can improve youth''s capability for managing their digital identities; b) to understand the value of pedagogies of play. Using participant observation, focus group and interviews, youth behaviours and attitudes towards this game based learning approach as well as their perceptions of their digital rights are presented.'),

The main goal of this monograph is to understand parents'' beliefs about the role of emotions in the family and how cultural or ethnic background may influence those beliefs. Based on philosophical traditions and previous research, three dimensions of parental beliefs were predicted: Value of Emotion, Socialization of Emotion, and Controllability of Emotion. We expected new themes to emerge during the focus groups. Twelve focus groups were conducted with 87 parents from the three cultural groups mentioned above. Groups met for two sessions scheduled 2 weeks apart. Focus group discussions were led by same-ethnicity moderators. An inductive analysis was conducted; key themes and subthemes were identified. All three theoretically derived dimensions were well represented in each focus group. Cultural similarities in themes within these dimensions included children''s appropriate expression of negative emotions, role of emotion in the home, children''s capacity for controlling emotions, and parents'' role in socialization of emotion. Cultural variations included concern about parents'' expression of negative emotion, children''s modulation of positive emotion, the role emotions play in behavior, and choice in emotional experience. Two new dimensions also emerged: Relational Nature of Emotions and Changeability of Emotions. Cultural similarities in themes within these dimensions included emphasis on emotional connections with children, emotional contagion in families, developmental change in children''s emotions, and inter-generational change in emotion socialization. Cultural variation included discussion of emotions as guides for action and children''s emotional privacy. Dimensions and the themes and subthemes within them are presented with supporting evidence and sources. Implications of parental beliefs for emotion socialization theory and future research, as well as limitations, are discussed. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)'),

Ethical, evidence-informed decision making is undermined by the grave concerns that have emerged over the trustworthiness of clinical trials published in biomedical journals. The inescapable conclusion from this growing body of research is that what we see, even in the most highly regarded peer-reviewed journals, cannot be trusted at face value. Concerns of inaccurate, biased, and insufficient reporting of trials are impossible to resolve without access to underlying trial data. Access to such data, including things like clinical study reports—huge, unabridged, detailed reports of clinical trials—would minimise the risk of distortions and selective publication. But the FDA, the world’s greatest custodian of those data, just sits on them. We see no reason why FDA should not publicly release clinical study reports with minimal redactions. The European regulator is already doing this, but FDA’s holdings are far greater. Data transparency is not simply an “opportunity” FDA might consider, but rather an ethical imperative. The Blueprint is good but does not go far enough. We do not need gates, barriers and committees between us and access to aggregate reports on drugs and other interventions which we are prescribing or using daily. Let’s leave the nannies at home.'),

Background The use of social media (SM) as a surveillance tool of global illicit drug use is limited. To address this limitation, a systematic review of literature focused on the ability of SM to better recognize illicit drug use trends was addressed. Methods A search was conducted in databases: PubMed, CINAHL via Ebsco, PsychINFO via Ebsco, Medline via Ebsco, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, ABI/INFORM Complete and Communication and Mass Media Complete. Included studies were original research published in peer-reviewed journals between January 2005 and June 2015 that primarily focused on collecting data from SM platforms to track trends in illicit drug use. Excluded were studies focused on purchasing prescription drugs from illicit online pharmacies. Results Selected studies used a range of SM tools/applications, including message boards, Twitter and blog/forums/platform discussions. Limitations included relevance, a lack of standardized surveillance systems and a lack of efficient algorithms to isolate relevant items. Conclusion Illicit drug use is a worldwide problem, and the rise of global social networking sites has led to the evolution of a readily accessible surveillance tool. Systematic approaches need to be developed to efficiently extract and analyze illicit drug content from social networks to supplement effective prevention programs.'),

By allowing any person to request any records for any reason, it was meant to open up government for all to see. Investigative journalists, watchdog groups, and concerned citizens would all jump at the chance to hold officials accountable and unearth secretive government actions. The numbers seem to support a FOIA success story: after all, the government now consistently receives over 700,000 FOIA requests a year. As it turns out, however, it is not journalists and nonprofits who are making hundreds of thousands of requests. In my previous article, FOIA, Inc., I documented how commercial requesters have dominated the FOIA landscape at some agencies, particularly large regulatory agencies. In doing so, they have transformed FOIA into a sort of giveaway to businesses, to the potential detriment of those whose requests promote government oversight. This Article reveals the unexpected uses of FOIA at another group of agencies, particularly those focused on law enforcement and benefits provision. At these agencies, FOIA requests are dominated by individuals seeking records about themselves: for example, their own medical files, immigration records, or investigation files. In fact, these requesters--whom I call first-person FOIA requesters--appear to vastly outnumber commercial requesters. At the Department of Homeland Security alone, more than 200,000 first-person requests are filed each year. Using original datasets and interviews with requesters, this Article documents the extent and nature of firstperson FOIA requesting at seven federal agencies. It also demonstrates that, while these requests may serve vital private interests for each requester, they largely do not serve the public''s interest in knowing what its government is up to. These accounts not only suggest that FOIA may be suffering under the weight of unintended uses, but also reveal how first-person requesters are often ill-served when they are forced to use FOIA simply because no good alternative exists. Moreover, it reveals how agencies themselves duplicate work and hinder their own objectives by requiring that first-person information needs be met through FOIA. Important conclusions follow from these insights. Agencies should meet firstperson information needs head-on by designing sensible processes for obtaining commonly needed personal information. Alleviating the need to resort to FOIA would provide benefits that inure to individuals, agencies, and the public''s interest in transparency.'),

the predicate to enforcing arbitration obligations under the Federal Arbitration Act and the reorientation of court-based procedures to assimilate judges’ activities to those of other dispute resolution providers. From 1925 until the mid-1980s, obligations to arbitrate rested on consent.
Thereafter, the U.S. Supreme Court shifted course and enforced court and class action waivers
mandated when consumers purchased goods and employees applied for jobs. To explain the
legitimacy of precluding court access for federal and state claims, the Court developed new
rationales—that arbitration had procedural advantages over adjudication, and that arbitration
was an effective enforcement mechanism to “vindicate” public rights.
The result has been the mass production of arbitration clauses without a mass of arbitrations. Although hundreds of millions of consumers and employees are obliged to use arbitration
as their remedy, almost none do so—rendering arbitration not a vindication but an unconstitutional evisceration of statutory and common law rights. The diffusion of disputes to a range of
private, unknowable alternative adjudicators also violates the constitutional protections accorded
to the public—endowed with the right to observe state-empowered decision makers as they impose binding outcomes on disputants. Closed processes preclude the public from assessing the
qualities of what gains the force of law and debating what law ought to require. The cumulative
effect of the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on arbitration has been to produce an unconstitutional system that undermines both the legitimacy of arbitration and the functions of courts.'),

Agency theory suggests that managers and investors have different preferences over such risk because investors can diversity their capital over different firms to reduce firm-specific risk but managers cannot diversify their investment of human capital in their firm. Therefore managers face greater personal cost of financial distress during their limited tenure. We develop an analytical model for optimally allocating investments to general productive assets and specific cyber-security assets incorporating costs of security breaches, borrowing and financial distress. We note that investment in productive assets can generate cash flows that allow the firm to better withstand security threats in the long run but investment in specific security-enhancing assets reduce security breaches in short run while leaving the firm''s finances vulnerable over a longer period. Using our model, we show that managers over-invest in specific security-enhancing assets to reduce security breaches during their tenure. We then incorporate cyber-insurance in our model and show that it has the effect of reducing managers'' over-investment in specific security-enhancing assets.'),

This task is fraught with difficulties and uncertainty, making the knowledge provided by human experts essential for successful assessment. Today, the increasing number of progressively complex systems has led to an urgent need to produce tools that support the expert-led process of system-security assessment. In this research, we use weighted averages (WAs) and ordered weighted averages (OWAs) with evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to create aggregation operators that model parts of the assessment process. We show how individual overall ratings for security components can be produced from ratings of their characteristics, and how these individual overall ratings can be aggregated to produce overall rankings of potential attacks on a system. As well as the identification of salient attacks and weak points in a prospective system, the proposed method also highlights which factors and security components contribute most to a component''s difficulty and attack ranking respectively. A real world scenario is used in which experts were asked to rank a set of technical attacks, and to answer a series of questions about the security components that are the subject of the attacks. The work shows how finding good aggregation operators, and identifying important components and factors of a cyber-security problem can be automated. The resulting operators have the potential for use as decision aids for systems designers and cyber-security experts, increasing the amount of assessment that can be achieved with the limited resources available.'),

The preparation of a graduate level cyber security and forensics course in a computer science department that addresses theory, policy, and application for a multidisciplinary student audience can be daunting when the majority of students in the class do not have a computer science background. The course takes a holistic approach to broaden knowledge and deepen understanding of the domain of cyber security using cross disciplinary teams to gain understanding and experience taking theory to practice and practice to theory. A framework of understanding is built through the examination of the body of scholarly conceptual and technical works and hands on experience with hardware and software platforms and networks. Computer Science provides the theoretical underpinnings and technical details, methods, and tools to examine security concepts; Forensic Science provides the approach to critical analysis of digital evidence; and Behavioral Analysis provided a way to synthesize knowledge and scientific method to gain some understanding of criminal behavior as well as the breadth and economic impact of cybercrime. This approach resulted in students who gained technical proficiency and perspective and experience working with people with divergent backgrounds, abilities and knowledge sets.'),

It is extremely difficult to secure these cyber-physical systems (CPS) due to the complexity of their interfaces, which often leaves them exposed to elevated levels of risk to severe disruptions, including information security violations that could threaten national and economic security. Therefore, many researchers have dedicated substantial effort to model and analyze cyber-physical systems through red teaming in order to identify various potential strategies an attacker may take to hack into the system so that they can develop effective countermeasures. Reliability and risk modeling approaches discussed in the literature include fault trees (FT), event trees (ET), binary decision diagrams (BDD), Petri nets (PN), Markov modeling (MM), and attack trees (AT) to systematically characterize the risks latent in cyber-physical systems. This paper provides a survey of the two most popular modeling approaches including fault and attack trees, discussing their benefits and potential limitations. This survey should be beneficial to security professionals who wish to apply techniques from reliability and risk modeling to ensure the cyber security of their systems as well as researchers seeking to identify new modeling opportunities.'),

Rather than producing more security, we seem to be facing less and less. The reason for this is a multi-dimensional and multi-faceted security dilemma that extends beyond the state and its interaction with other states. It will be shown how the focus on the state and ''its'' security crowds out consideration for the security of the individual citizen, with detrimental effects on the security of the whole system. The threat arising from cyberspace to (national) security is presented as possible disruption to a specific way of life, one building on information technologies and critical functions of infrastructures, with relatively little consideration for humans directly. This non-focus on people makes it easier for state actors to militarize cyber-security and (re-)assert their power in cyberspace, thereby overriding the different security needs of human beings in that space. Paradoxically, the use of cyberspace as a tool for national security, both in the dimension of war fighting and the dimension of mass-surveillance, has detrimental effects on the level of cyber-security globally. A solution out of this dilemma is a cyber-security policy that is decidedly anti-vulnerability and at the same time based on strong considerations for privacy and data protection. Such a security would have to be informed by an ethics of the infosphere that is based on the dignity of information related to human beings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Everyday physical items such as lights, locks and industrial machineries can now be part of the IoT ecosystem. IoT has redefined the management of critical and non-critical systems with the aim of making our lives more safe, efficient and comfortable. As a result, IoT technology is having a huge positive impact on our lives. However, in addition to these positives, IoT systems have also attracted negative attention from malicious users who aim to infiltrate weaknesses within IoT systems for their own gain, referred to as cyber security attacks. By creating an introduction to IoT, this paper seeks to highlight IoT cyber security vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques to the reader.The paper is suitable for developers, practitioners, and academics, particularly from fields such as computer networking, information or communication technology or electronics. The paper begins by introducing IoT as the culmination of two hundred years of evolution within communication technologies. Around 2014, IoT reached consumers, early products were mostly small closed IoT networks, followed by large networks such as smart cities, and continuing to evolve into Next Generation Internet; internet systems which incorporate human values. Following this evolutionary introduction, IoT architectures are compared and some of the technologies that are part of each architectural layer are introduced. Security threats within each architectural layer and some mitigation strategies are discussed, finally, the paper concludes with some future developments.'),

In the present study, security related events that affected chemical and process sites, and related infrastructures, were investigated. The aim of the study is to frame a clear picture of the threats affecting the chemical and process industry, and to issue lessons learnt from past events. A database of 300 security-related accidents was developed and populated, starting from European and American sources. Threat categories that caused such events were identified and analyzed. The attack modes were investigated. Important differences were found with respect to geographical areas and industrial sectors affected. The use of explosives (both military and improvised explosive devices) is by far the more frequent attack mode, although armed attacks and arson are also frequent events and may result in an in-depth penetration of the attackers. In recent years, cyber-attacks are also posing important threats. Lessons learnt call for the implementation of a specific security management system in the chemical and process industry, aiming at the physical and cyber protection of industrial sites.

Various technical and regulatory concerns have been raised that IoT-operated loads are being deployed without appropriately considering and systematically addressing potential cyber-security challenges. Hence, one can envision a hypothetical scenario when an ensemble of IoT-controlled loads can be hacked with malicious intentions of compromising operations of the electrical grid. Under this scenario, the attacker would use geographically distributed IoT-controlled loads to alternate their net power injections into the electrical grid in such a way that may disrupt normal grid operations. This paper presents a modeling framework to analyze grid impacts of distributed cyber-attacks on IoT-controlled loads. This framework is used to demonstrate how a hypothetical distributed cyber-attack propagates from the distribution electrical grid, where IoT-controlled loads are expected to be installed, to the transmission electrical grid. The techno-economic interactions between the distribution and transmission electrical grids are accounted for by means of bilevel optimization. The case study is carried out on the modified versions of the 3-area IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) and the IEEE 13-bus distribution feeder. Our numerical results demonstrate that the severity of such attacks depends on the penetration level of IoT-controlled loads and the strategy of the attacker.'),

Motivated by the increasing need for robust and safe operation of AGCs, we introduce an attack resilient control scheme for the AGC system based on attack detection using state estimation. The proposed approach requires redundancy of sensors available at the transmission level in the power network and leverages recent results on attack detection using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The proposed algorithm detects and identifies the sensors under attack in the presence of noise. The non-attacked sensors are then averaged and made available to the feedback controller. No assumptions about the nature of the attack signal are made. The proposed method is simulated using a large range of attack signals and uncertain sensors measurements.'),

We present two examples: the first demonstrates how leveraging behavioral science leads to clear improvements, and the other illustrates how behavioral science offers the potential for significant increases in the effectiveness of cyber security. Based on feedback collected from practitioners in preliminary interviews, we narrow our focus to two important behavioral aspects: cognitive load and bias. Next, we identify proven and potential behavioral science findings that have cyber security relevance, not only related to cognitive load and bias but also to heuristics and behavioral science models.

This method can be used to analyze and quantify safety levels of different roads, to extract principle components and to carry out clustering classification for comprehensive evaluation function of principle components through Canopy-Kmeans ensemble clustering algorithm so as to extract accident hotspots. The hotspots identification experiment on Anhui section of G50 Hu-Yu highway showed that principle component-clustering analysis method can not only be used to carry out scientific accident statistics analysis and effectively identify accident hotspots, but also to reflect real traffic safety situation, which will help to provide scientific and reasonable basis for improvement of traffic safety decision making performance.'),

Privately owned and operated critical infrastructure that is regarded as a potential national security vulnerability raises questions about the allocation of responsibility and accountability in terms of cyber security. As with many aspects of cyber security, this issue is often discussed with little reference to previous scholarship that could provide conceptual scaffolding. This article draws on the extensive literature on public-private partnerships in order to assess the tensions and challenges of this arrangement in national cyber-security strategies. It finds that there is a serious disjuncture in expectations from both ''partners''. The government regards privately owned and operated critical infrastructure as a key element of national security but is reluctant to claim a mandate to oversee network security. At the same time, the private sector is not inclined to accept responsibility or liability for national cyber security. This challenge for governments to manage national cyber security raises questions about how well equipped these states are to promote their own security in the information age. Acknowledging the flaws in the ''partnership'' is an essential step towards addressing them. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Indeed, the importance of physical and cyber security for smart grids has been highlighted by recent intrusion incidents worldwide. Various types of sensors, instrumentation, information and communications technology ( ICT), computational methodologies, and security controls have been developed to enhance the physical and cyber security of the smart grid. In this paper, critical vulnerabilities of a smart grid that can be exploited for physical and cyber intrusions are discussed. A comprehensive survey is conducted on the state-of-the-art research to enhance the physical and cyber security in a smart grid environment.

ADS-B systems have the capability of providing air traffic controllers with highly accurate real-time flight data. ADS-B is dependent on digital communications between aircraft and ground stations of the air route traffic control center (ARTCC); however these communications are not secured. Anyone with the appropriate capabilities and equipment can interrogate the signal and transmit their own false data; this is known as spoofing. The possibility of this type of attacks decreases the situational awareness of United States airspace. The purpose of this project is to design a secure transmission framework that prevents ADS-B signals from being spoofed. Three alternative methods of securing ADS-B signals are evaluated: hashing, symmetric encryption, and asymmetric encryption. Security strength of the design alternatives is determined from research. Feasibility criteria are determined by comparative analysis of alternatives. Economic implications and possible collision risk is determined from simulations that model the United State airspace over the Gulf of Mexico and part of the airspace under attack respectively. The ultimate goal of the project is to show that if ADS-B signals can be secured, the situational awareness can improve and the ARTCC can use information from this surveillance system to decrease the separation between aircraft and ultimately maximize the use of the United States airspace.'),

Therefore, social networks using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been constructed. As ICT continues to be used in various modern applications, security vulnerabilities from legacy ICT have been inherited by social IoT network systems. To guarantee the safety of these applications, these networks must be protected from various cyberattacks. A variety of security technologies and products have been developed for this purpose. However, the most important task in dealing with cyberattacks is to inspect the current security status of a social IoT network system. Many types of vulnerability quantification methods exist for inspecting the security vulnerabilities of network systems. However, with legacy methods, quantification results lack objectivity. In this study, to compensate for this limitation, we propose a game-theory-based vulnerability quantification method using attack tree, which consists of three steps: game strategy modeling, cost-impact analyzation, and payoff calculation. We present a case study for a social-IoT-based network environment. Using the proposed method, we believe social IoT network system security experts will be able to cope with security incidents more effectively. The proposed method can be used as a reference for constructing a safer social IoT network system.'),

Here, precision medicine influences the way to treat the information and get a better outcome to support the stakeholder decision. Online social networks analysis seems to be good tools to quickly monitor the population behavior where users freely share large amounts of information related to their own lives on day- to- day basis. This novel kind of data can be used to get additional real time insights from people to understand their actual behavior related to drug use (Cortés et al., 2017). The aim of this research is to generated an information fusion model of marijuana use tendency confident enough to be employed by stakeholders. So, we will: (a) collect and process the data from Twitter; (b) design a set of algorithms to estimate the tendency of marijuana use in relation to age, localization and gender, moreover, used a set of processes and activities to verify if our model were performing as expected; and (c) fusion of the information in a model to fully characterize the marijuana use population comparable to the national marijuana consume survey for policy makers utilization to improve drug use prevention. First,we collect the data from Twitter accounts based in Chile using an algorithm for traversing graph data structures, we collected the data from Twitter accounts based in Chile. Then, we estimated marijuana user prevalence during a period from 2006 to 2018 and, within each of the years we predicted the prevalence of user population in relation with age (in range), the localization (regions) and gender. Finally, we built indicators to explore the similarity between data obtained through Twitter (our results) and the actual data collected by the National Service for the Prevention and Rehabilitation of Drug and Alcohol (SENDA) under the same variables analyze in their own survey. When we compare the results of the algorithms and methods developed by us with those provided by the SENDA, we observed that most of the indicators present similar trends, i.e., the variation of the prevalence by years in the age, location and gender, showed similar changes in both analyzes. Also, the algorithms effectiveness and capacity to predict variations of complex cases like marijuana use in Chilean population. This study is a key opportunity to obtain in a faster, low cost and continuous way information about marijuana use, also, is an excellent tool for marijuana surveillance to get information to support policy makers and stakeholder decisions.'),

Mobile Internet technologies make electronic surveillance easier, but effective monitoring harder, as keeping track of the content and importance of individual communications requires time and trustworthy judgment calls that cannot be automated or outsourced.While unbounded surveillance may be a useful tool for keeping control of political subdivisions, it can be very bad for business. Companies want to protect their trade secrets, and control access to their financial data and other proprietary information, and they want to engage in confidential communications. Businesses also want access to the same information and Internet resources as their competitors abroad. The people running China would like to attract and retain all manner of sophisticated business ventures, but simultaneously wish to spy extensively on these companies and on the people who run them. And the Internet access that is generally available is censored and ponderously slow due to the extensive monitoring and filtering technologies that are in place. The CPC probably can’t have it both ways. If secure communication channels are not consistently available to private sector businesses within China, enterprises that value or require confidentiality will limit their in-country transactions. Some foreign companies may avoid doing business there altogether.

The city granted a new franchise agreement to the private companies behind LinkNYC, which would then install thousands of sidewalk kiosks to bathe the city in free high-speed wireless internet ("Wi-Fi"). The program would allow the city to accomplish two goals: bridge the digital divide and make New York a more modern "smart city." In exchange, LinkNYC''s backers would receive lucrative advertising revenue. But LinkNYC also had a potentially sinister side: the specter of a mass surveillance network of cameras and sensors for law enforcement to follow New Yorkers wherever they went. A public outcry erupted. In response, LinkNYC changed its privacy policy to curtail the amount of information the kiosks could collect. With these changes in place, the network''s deployment has continued unabated, even as some concerns still linger about what data, exactly, the kiosks collect, with whom the data is shared, and how the data is used. The changing privacy policy showed both the promise and the limits of relying on voluntary privacy policies to protect New Yorkers from mass surveillance. The privacy policy changed in reaction to public opinion before anyone could attempt to look to the courts for clarity on the kiosks'' data collection. The courts, however, are not necessarily able to provide clear guidance as they grapple with everchanging new technology. Indeed, the kiosks themselves combine several types of data collection that are each subject to different lines of Fourth Amendment cases, including real-time location tracking, historical location data, and (potentially) facial recognition technology'),

Through thematic analyses, we identified and compared privacy/confidentiality concerns associated with two survey methods that (1) collect self-reported addresses/cross-streets and (2) use an interactive web-based map to find/confirm locations in rural and urban settings.Results: Concerns differed more by setting than between methods. For example, (1) rural participants valued interviewer rapport and protections provided by the Certificate of Confidentiality more; (2) locations considered to be sensitive differed in rural (i.e., others'' homes) and urban (i.e., where drugs were used) settings; and (3) urban participants were more likely to view providing cross-streets as an acceptable alternative to providing exact addresses for sensitive locations and to prefer the web-based map approach.Conclusion: Rural-urban differences in privacy/confidentiality concerns reflect contextual differences (i.e., where drugs are used/purchased, population density, and prior drug-related arrests). Strategies to alleviate concerns include: (1) obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality, (2) collect geographic data at the scale necessary for proposed analyses, and (3) permit participants to provide intersections/landmarks in close proximity to actual locations rather than exact addresses or to skip questions where providing an intersection/landmark would not obfuscate the actual address.'),

The Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN – www.aurin.org.au) project is one example of such a big data initiative that is currently running across Australia. AURIN provides a single gateway providing online (live) programmatic access to over 2000 data sets from over 70 major and typically definitive data-driven organizations across federal and State government, across industry and across academia. However whilst open (public) data is useful to bring data-driven intelligence to cities, more often than not, it is the data that is not-publicly accessible that is essential to understand city challenges and needs. Such sensitive (unit-level) data has unique requirements on access and usage to meet the privacy and confidentiality demands of the associated organizations. In this paper we highlight a novel geo-privacy supporting solution implemented as part of the AURIN project that provides seamless and secure access to individual (unit-level) data from the Department of Health in Victoria. We illustrate this solution across a range of typical city challenges in localized contexts around Melbourne. We show how unit level data can be combined with other data in a privacy-protecting manner. Unlike other secure data access and usage solutions that have been developed/deployed, the AURIN solution allows any researcher to access and use the data in a manner that meets all of the associated privacy and confidentiality concerns, without obliging them to obtain ethical approval or any other hurdles that are normally put in place on access to and use of sensitive data.

An on-board unit (OBU) is required to transfer data collected from sensors to the back-end server through various wireless networks, such as DSRC/WAVE, cellular networks, WiMAX, and WLAN/Wi-Fi. However, in any of such deployment, OBU should be equipped with an expensive transmitter. After transmitted to the server, those data can be further processed for many applications, such as automated traffic enforcement, Pay-as-You-Drive insurance, electronic toll pricing, and traffic statistics. Such raw data always contains vehicle and driver’s private information. Considering both cost and privacy concerns, we propose a new vehicle urban sensing infrastructure. Instead of deploying an expensive transmitter on OBU, we choose to use smartphone to transfer data through cellular network, which can be communicated with OBU equipped with a cheaper Bluetooth transmitter. To achieve privacy, we design an efficient protocol among OBU, smartphone, and back-end server by using some cryptographic techniques. Compare with the traditional OBU with 3G module (231 USD), the OBU we use is much cheaper (44.6 USD). Our protocol is also efficient enough to be deployed in practice.'),

To address these three issues concurrently, we propose a novel delay-aware privacy-preserving (DAPP) transmission scheme based on a combination of two-phase forwarding and secret sharing. In DAPP, the collected data are first split into pieces, and then, each piece is relayed to an application data server by randomly selected intermediate delivery nodes. The two-phase forwarding method detaches the connection between the application data server and the source node, which renders it infeasible for the application data server to estimate the source node identity. The underlying secret sharing scheme and dynamic pseudonym ensure confidentiality of the collected data and anonymity of participating users. Through DAPP, we can also verify data integrity in hostile networks. Moreover, DAPP provides a framework to achieve a design tradeoff among security, communication delay, and delivery ratio. The security analysis demonstrates that DAPP can preserve location privacy while defending against side information attack. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the three design issues can be adjusted to meet various security and practical implementation goals.'),

The City of Toronto''s recent award to Alphabet''s Sidewalk Lab for design services has sparked a heated controversy among urban planners and citizens alike. Toronto''s decision not only signals a different model of professional practice, but it also represents a conceptual shift away from citizen to urban consumer. By engaging a private technology company, one that passively captures data on its customers and then re-sales that data to third parties, Toronto''s smart city points to a significant change in the understanding and practice of contemporary urban planning and design. Acknowledging the city as a site of disciplinary disruption, this paper introduces Bratton''s stack theory as a way to understand networked urbanism more generally, and Waterfront Toronto specifically. We build on Bratton''s position by closely examining twenty-first century histories and anthropologies related to the Internet, privacy, and the dominance of big data. Our principal concern is with the transformation of personal and environmental data into an economic resource. Seen through that particular lens, we argue that Toronto''s smart city has internalized relations of colonization, whereby the economic objectives of a multinational technology company take on new configurations at a local level of human (and non-human) information extraction - thereby restructuring not only public land, but also everyday life into a zone of unmitigated consumption.'),

Revolutionary computing paradigms, such as people-centric urban sensing, have focused on the seamless collection of meaningful data from a large number of devices. The increasing complexity of deployed urban systems and related infrastructures, along with the growing amount of information collected, prompts a number of challenging security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we explore a number of scenarios where nodes of a urban sensing system are subject to individual queries. In this setting, multiple users and organizations (e.g., infrastructure operators) co-exist, but they may not trust each other to the full extent. As a result, we address the problems of protecting: 1) secrecy of reported data, and 2) confidentiality of query interests from the prying eyes of malicious entities. We introduce a realistic network model and study different adversarial models and strategies, distinguishing between resident and nonresident adversaries, considering both randomly distributed and local attackers. For each of them, we propose a distributed privacy-preserving technique and evaluate its effectiveness via analysis and simulation. Our techniques are tunable, trading off the level of privacy assurance with a small overhead increase, and independent from the complexity of the underlying infrastructures. We additionally provide a relevant improvement of data reliability and availability, while only relying on standard symmetric cryptography.

However, to the best of our knowledge, (1) different privacy metrics have never been compared to each other, and (2) it is unknown how strong the metrics are. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the strength of 41 privacy metrics in terms of four novel criteria: Privacy metrics should be monotonic, i.e., indicate decreasing privacy for increasing adversary strength; their values should be spread evenly over a large value range to support within-scenario comparability; and they should share a large portion of their value range between traffic conditions to support between-scenario comparability. We evaluate all four criteria on real and synthetic traffic with state-of-the-art adversary models and create a ranking of privacy metrics. Our results indicate that no single metric dominates across all criteria and traffic conditions.

One such conflict affecting many hill-dwelling urban households is achieving the balance between one household''s privacy and another''s views. A typical scenario might involve a hillside house providing its residents with views, perhaps of a harbour or cityscape, and with this comes a desire to preserve those views, free from impeding trees, hedges or fences. Lower down on the hill, and perhaps directly next door, is a neighbouring household that seeks privacy from the house above, that may look directly into their house or backyard. This privacyseeking household would prefer that there is some sort of barrier to preserve their privacy, such as a fence or tall tree, in clear conflict with the desires of the view-seeking household. This exact conflict played out recently in the New Zealand courts in the widely publicised case of Aitchison v Walmsley.1 The case, which involved two separate (but related) decisions by the Environment Court in 2015 and 2016, involved the Aitchisons, who fulfil the role of the view-seeking household. The Aitchisons lived on a hill in the Wellington suburb of Roseneath, at a property that had once enjoyed expansive harbour views. However, those views had been impeded by the Walmsleys, who fulfil the role of the privacy-seeking household. The Walmsleys lived at an adjacent neighbouring property lower on the hill, and built a fence-like structure at the boundary of the two properties to protect their privacy. The Environment Court was called upon to decide on the legality of the Walmsleys'' structure and whether it should be removed. Essentially the Court was asked to resolve the conflict of privacy versus views. As well as raising various legal and planning issues, the case serves to illustrate some important principles in the field of law and economics, centred on the concept of an "externality". An externality is a cost or benefit imposed by the actions of one party on a bystander - a person (or persons) not involved in the original action, and who did not choose to incur the cost or benefit. Indeed, the Walmsleys'' action to build a structure on their boundary imposed a cost on the Aitchisons by impairing their views. However, as this article will explain, the nature of externalities is in fact more nuanced than this simple explanation suggests.'),

In the IoT paradigm, various information and communication technologies (ICTs) are used in concert to substantially reduce urban problems. Smart cities and ubiquitous cities will adopt ICTs in the urban development process; however, IoT-based cities will experience considerably stronger effects than those that adopt conventional ICTs. IoT cities allow urban residents and “things”to be connected to the Internet by virtue of the extension of the Internet Protocol from IPv4 to IPv6 and of cutting-edge device and sensor technology. Therefore, the urban transition resulting from the influence of IoT may be a critical issue. The privacy-related vulnerabilities of IoT technologies may negatively affect city residents. Furthermore, disparities in the spread of IoT systems across different countries may allow some countries to subvert the privacy of other countries'' citizens. The aim of this paper is to identify the potential prospects and privacy challenges that will emerge from IoT deployment in urban environments. This paper reviews the prospects of and barriers to IoT implementation at the regional, city, and residential scales from the perspectives of security and privacy. The IoT technology will be a continual presence in life in general and in urban life in particular. However, the adoption of the IoT paradigm in cities will be complicated due to the inherent presence of unsecured connections. Moreover, the IoT systems may rob people of some of their humanity, infringing on their privacy, because people are also regarded as “things”in the IoT paradigm.

The most obvious effect is that increases in productivity due to technology can eliminate jobs. Technology affects the individual worker, in the nature and amount of his work, and in his attitudes toward that work. Technological change affects the occupational structure of the entire labor force. Because of the central importance of these effects, the impact of technology has been the subject of extensive study by economists, sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists. Even within a single discipline, studies are often contradictory, and conclusions are colored by political overtones. We wish to delineate some of the issues, and present arguments given to support different viewpoints. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

There is a corresponding rise in the volume of machine-readable stored information including information about individuals at various data gathering points of society. However, more and more thought is being given to ways in which integrated use might be made of information which is available within society, but which lies dispersed in individual legal documents, archives or even data banks, firstly, in order to avoid double storage and duplication, and secondly, in order to achieve fuller use of data in relation to the data base employed. These two aims could be achieved by integrated data-bank-related information systems. The integration of data files within a data bank can be achieved by use of the computer-oriented data bank, which may be distinguished from other data banks such as card indexes, filing systems and archives by the fact that, owing to the computers storage and access capacity, once data elements have been put in an adequate format, they can be used as ordering criteria. Storing information in integrated data-bank-related information systems, of which data transfer is an integral part, enables one to overcome not only the poor data-access, and limited possibilities for the integration of data elements, resulting from the nature of conventional storage carriers and the physical separation of data files, but also the difficulty of integrating data files in different specialized data banks.'),

The fact that a good number of social ills stemming from the presence of monopoly and monopsony power in the political economy are handled by subsidies in the market for information stands as mute testimony to the pervasiveness of this phenomenon. Subsidies in the information market have an enormous impact in affecting the participatory revolution manifested in all forms of social protest, including ecological protest, simply by changing the attitudes of consumers, voters, and lawmakers. While the benefits of new technology are heralded in modern folklore, there persists at the same time a residue of romantic, pastoralist hostility to technological change. The Competitive Ethic is a lable attach to the set of shared values that legitimacy to the modern corporate state and supercorporation. The information explosion simultaneously increases the ability to learn to cope with the stresses of technological change as man adopts new ways of satisfying his basic needs for privacy, participation, relaxation etc.'),

Using information as a basis for developing a structure for, and outlining the flows in, an urban area, this paper develops a dual hierarchy of information requirements and management activities. Each level of the hierarchy is discussed in terms of the emergent problems and requirements that are likely to confront management scientists and urban administrators in the future. As the information requirements of urban areas become more complex and as the components of the urban system become more highly interrelated, developments in information technology can be expected to have a direct impact on the activities of urban area administrators. This development is illustrated here through the presentation of a selected number of possible impacts of information technology developments upon the information and management hierarchies of urban systems.

Impact assessments of information technology are also often limited to privacy impact assessments, which are focused on individual rights and well-being, as opposed to the social environment. In this article, I argue that this perspective is too narrow, in terms of understanding the complexity of the relation between information technology and society, as well as in terms of directions for managing this relation. I use systems theory to show that current approaches focus mostly on individual impact of information technology developments rather than their mediating role in society itself. I argue that this should be complemented by an analysis of impact on individuals (psychic systems) via co-construction of the environment (social system). I then take up the question of what the role of information technology in social systems would look like in terms of the social relations of trust and power, and how this can complement privacy in discussions on impacts of information technology.

Our study aims to understand Taiwanese university students'' privacy concerns and protective behaviours in relation to online targeting ads and their habitual smartphone usage. Surveying 810 valid subjects, our results first propose that ad relevance has direct bearing on attention to ads. Second, ad relevance inversely correlates with privacy concerns (i.e. descending personal control and surging corporate power) and protective behaviours (self-filtering and ad evasion). Third and finally, neither privacy concerns nor protective behaviours have a negative bearing on habitual smartphone usage. Opposite to previous research, our study concludes that Taiwanese college students exhibit zero privacy paradox, owing to no signs of privacy concern incited by mobile targeting ads, no evidence of significant protective behaviours, and no decreasing habitual smartphone usage out of privacy concern and protection. Our findings indicate Taiwanese university students'' shaky awareness of potential risks and crises from exposure to vulnerable online pnvacy management. To deal with this, we suggest educating youths'' understandings of digital jeopardy by experts is urgently needed more so than |ust technical tutonals of privacy settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Self-tracking technologies are promoted and used as a means to self-improvement. Based on large aggregates of personal data and the data of other users, self-tracking technologies offer personalized feedback that nudges the user into behavioral change. The real-time personalization of choice architectures requires continuous surveillance and is a very powerful technology, recently coined as "hypernudging." While users celebrate the increased personalization of their coaching devices, "hypernudging" technologies raise concerns about manipulation. This paper addresses that intuition by claiming that decisional privacy is at stake. It thus counters the trend to solely focus on informational privacy when evaluating information and communication technologies. It proposes that decisional privacy and informational privacy are often part of a mutually reinforcing dynamic. Hypernudging is used as a key example to illustrate that the two dimensions should not be treated separately. Hypernudging self-tracking technologies compromise autonomy because they violate informational and decisional privacy. In order to effectively judge whether technologies that use hypernudges empower users, we need both privacy dimensions as conceptual tools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Hypertext Transport Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a form of Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) that enables secure communication over the public internet and provides a deterministic way to guarantee data confidentiality so that attackers cannot eavesdrop on communications. HTTPS has been used to protect sensitive information exchanges, but security exploits such as passive and active attacks have exposed the need to implement HTTPS in a more rigorous and pervasive manner. This report is intended to shed light on the state of HTTPS implementation in libraries, and to suggest ways in which libraries can evaluate and improve application security so that they can better protect the confidentiality of PII about library patrons.

Though library classes on educating patrons'' privacy protection are a valiant effort, we can do so much more and lead the way, maybe not for the privacy industry but for our communities and patrons.

This is a challenge when designing tools and approaches for the use of Educational Big Data (EBD) and learning analytics (LA) in a global market. The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of information privacy in a cross-cultural setting to define a common point of reference for privacy engineering. Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows a conceptual exploration approach. Conceptual work on privacy in EBD and LA in China and the west is contrasted with the general discussion of privacy in a large corpus of literature and recent research. As much of the discourse on privacy has an American or European bias, intimate knowledge of Chinese education is used to test the concept of privacy and to drive the exploration of how information privacy is perceived in different cultural and educational settings. Findings: The findings indicate that there are problems using privacy concepts found in European and North-American theories to inform privacy engineering for a cross-cultural market in the era of Big Data. Theories based on individualism and ideas of control of private information do not capture current global digital practice. The paper discusses how a contextual and culture-aware understanding of privacy could be developed to inform privacy engineering without letting go of universally shared values. The paper concludes with questions that need further research to fully understand information privacy in education. Originality/value: As far as the authors know, this paper is the first attempt to discuss – from a comparative and cross-cultural perspective – information privacy in an educational context in the era of Big Data. The paper presents initial explorations of a problem that needs urgent attention if good intentions of privacy supportive educational technologies are to be turned into more than political slogans.

Abstract With increasing consumer awareness towards information privacy and government-enforced regulations on data protection, organizations are implementing Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to provide systematic protection on consumers'' personal data. Current PETs literature focused mostly on the design and implementation of the technology without touching on its impact. Implementation literature has also examined the effects of various technologies on changes in work processes and employee perception but has yet to explore that of PETs. Therefore, the objective of this study is to understand the effects of PETs implementation on employees'' work processes as well as their perception towards the implementation. In-depth interview data was collected from three groups of affected employees belonging to one large mobile telecommunications company. Results show that PETs affected workload, communication level and data access, which led to different levels of changes depending on the nature of the work. The employees perceived PETs as useful. However, they perceived the company as not being properly prepared for the implementation, and also raised concerns on vendor accountability and the sustainability of the PETs. Our findings have implications for organizations planning to implement PETs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Mobile application firms can collect granular and largely unregulated data about their consumers, and must make ethical decisions about how and whether to collect, store, and share these data. This paper conducts a discourse analysis of mobile application developer forums to discover when and how privacy conversations, as a representative of larger ethical debates, arise during development. It finds that online forums can be useful spaces for ethical deliberations, as developers use these spaces to define, discuss, and justify their values. It also discovers that ethical discussions in mobile development are prompted by work practices which vary considerably between iOS and Android, today''s two major mobile platforms. For educators, regulators, and managers interested in encouraging more ethical discussion and deliberation in mobile development, these work practices provide a valuable point of entry. But while the triggers for privacy conversations are quite different between platforms, ultimately the justifications for privacy are similar. Developers for both platforms use moral and cautionary tales, moral evaluation, and instrumental and technical rationalization to justify and legitimize privacy as a value in mobile development. Understanding these three forms of justification for privacy is useful to educators, regulators, and managers who wish to promote ethical practices in mobile development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Technology has provided solutions to access information, for communication and collaborative work. Blockchain emerges as a technology that can be useful for the development of an evaluation model of individualized learning itineraries in mass university subjects. In this line, the Edublocs project has been designed and executed, an initiative where these itineraries have been designed, incorporating elements of peer learning, teamteaching, PLEs, microlearning, technology-enhanced assessment... The objective of the Edublocs project is to design and implement a system of recording the results of activities through Blockchain that allow the student to follow a personal itinerary, and the teacher-tutor of the subject to carry out a formative evaluation and an accrediting appraisal of their work. The project is well underway in the evaluation of the implementation process. The experience with some elements of the design and the experimental execution in a formal university context during the present academic course, has allowed us to obtain important indications on the viability and relevance of the use of Blockchain in education. These, together with the explanation and justification of explaining the context of its applicability, will be laid out in the broad development of the article. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Specifically we consider: do different generations experience information and communication technology-mediated environments in the same way or not? Are there disjunctures or continuities in the experience of privacy across one generation? Do different generations have dissimilar attitudes about what constitutes a privacy invasion and different levels of concern about such invasions? Or is privacy a concern that develops as one ages through her life cycle and becomes more invested in the social and economic world? In other words, is information privacy, instead, something of a middle-age concern? To answer these questions, we first review the literature on generational differences, as well as the literature on privacy attitudes and introduce a number of hypotheses. We then analyze responses to two survey questions that have been asked periodically over the last 30 years to determine whether there are age cohort and/or generational differences. From the data examined, it is difficult to speak with any authority on the question of whether familiarity with technology means that younger generations or age cohorts are less concerned about technology or whether as all generations and age groups become familiar with technology privacy concerns decrease over time. However we do identify some interesting patterns. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

This study investigates this behavior and explores the paradox between industry reports and the academic CCS adoption literature. The majority of the academic literature shows that security and privacy beliefs are the major hindrances to wide adoption of CCS whilst multiple recent industrial reports state that security and privacy issues are no longer impediments to the use of CCS. The extensive sharing and storage of personal information among CCS regardless of any security and privacy concerns allows us to speculate about this paradox and provided insight for developing a cloud computing usage model. The posited model explores the influence of CCS main hindrances; that is, perceived security and perceived privacy, compared to the main determinants of technology adoption. The data was collected from 129 working professionals using a survey-based methodology. Contrary to the academic literature, the obtained results confirmed the hypotheses that cloud security and privacy concerns are not significant influences on information sharing and storage behavior. Peers influence was found a significant determinant of the behavior. The study contributes to the information systems and cloud computing literature and supports that the technology is perceived as able to protect user information. The analysis of the developed model provides multiple implications for researchers in academia and industry. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Under the new umbrella, Google''s search, data aggregation, and advertising subsidiaries, were joined by Sidewalk Lab and its suite of urban products: high-speed broadband services, Android Pixel2 phone, mobile mapping, autonomous cars, artificial intelligence, smart homes, and all the data captured therein. The City of Toronto''s recent award to Alphabet''s Sidewalk Lab for design services has sparked a heated controversy among urban planners and citizens alike. Toronto''s decision not only signals a different model of professional practice, but it also represents a conceptual shift away from citizen to urban consumer. By engaging a private technology company, one that passively captures data on its customers and then re-sales that data to third parties, Toronto''s smart city points to a significant change in the understanding and practice of contemporary urban planning and design. Acknowledging the city as a site of disciplinary disruption, this paper introduces Bratton''s stack theory as a way to understand networked urbanism more generally, and Waterfront Toronto specifically. We build on Bratton''s position by closely examining twenty-first century histories and anthropologies related to the Internet, privacy, and the dominance of big data. Our principal concern is with the transformation of personal and environmental data into an economic resource. Seen through that particular lens, we argue that Toronto''s smart city has internalized relations of colonization, whereby the economic objectives of a multinational technology company take on new configurations at a local level of human (and non-human) information extraction - thereby restructuring not only public land, but also everyday life into a zone of unmitigated consumption.

Following a multistep empirical procedure, we explore participants'' cognitions towards AD and CD. Therefore, a questionnaire study was run in which the perceived benefits and barriers of the technologies were evaluated by 443 participants in a wide age range (18-76 years). In addition, we took a closer look at the impact of user diversity (gender, age, need for privacy, control, risk taking tolerance and technical self-efficacy) on the evaluation of both driving technologies. Finally, cluster analyses were used out to identify evaluation profiles in both benefits and barriers, respectively. Overall, CD is seen significantly more positive compared to AD. With increasing risk taking tolerance and technical self-efficacy, the perception of the benefits was higher. In contrast, the perception of barriers in novel vehicle technologies was independent of personality factors and attitudes. Here, privacy and data protection issues were seen as key disadvantages. The findings can be used to develop timely and individually tailored public information and communication strategies for automated and connected vehicle technologies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

In this study, we adapt the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) to investigate factors predicting consumer behavioral intention (BI) and use behavior (UB) towards mobile shopping apps, considering the impact of two manifestations of consumer''s perceived risk: Privacy Risk and Security Risk. Because cultural characteristics may moderate the impact of these risks on behavioral intention and use behavior, we conduct two studies from two consumer panels from countries with significant difference in technology use as captured by the Computer-Based Media Support Index (CMSI), namely India (high CMSI) and USA (low CMSI). For both countries, the baseline UTAUT 2 constructs predict the Behavioral Intention to use mobile shopping apps (and subsequently use behavior). However, the manifestations of perceived risk are significant only for the country with the highest CMSI score, suggesting that cultural influences play a strong role in the adoption of m-shopping. Our study has practical implications for theory as it poses the use of m-shopping apps in a cross-cultural context, suggesting that privacy and security moderate intention to use differently across cultures as predicted by the CMSI. From that perspective, it also has practical implications for consumer behavior researchers and app developers challenged with app localization as well as retailers designing mobile shopping apps for an intercultural audience.

Delving into the design of public telephony, primarily in the United States, between 1880 and 1910, this article plumbs how telephone booths evolved to address the tangible by-products of soundproofing spaces for privacy. Health officials and the calling public targeted booth designs as seedy and infective, unresponsive to the sweat, respiration and odours callers'' bodies exuded. Seen as factors communicating diseases, these by-products turned telephony into a uniquely early ''viral'' technology, and technological touch into an involuntary, atmospheric and contaminating experience. As a corrective, US booths became wedded to air conditioning. The marriage secured public telephony as an individualized sensory space, and equated privacy with sanitation. This transformation integrated telephony into a larger design shift around the turn of the century towards tactile restraint, individuation, and hygiene, and reveals how health was designed into the very feel of early media artefacts.

These facts inevitably affect the perception of privacy and raise the question of whether privacy is dead or takes the last breath in the digital age? This paper is an attempt to address this question.Design/Methodology/Approach – Based on the comparison and systematic analysis of scientific literature, the authors discuss problematic issues related to privacy and data protection in the technology era – where these issues are too complicated to be clearly regulated by laws and rules since “laws move as a function of years and technology moves as a function of months” (Ron Rivest). Therefore, this analytical approach towards the issue may help to facilitate reaching the best-fit decision in this area.Findings – The authors emphasize the change of perception of privacy, which originated and grew on the idea of “an integral part of our humanity”, the “heart of our liberty” and “the beginning of all freedoms” (Solove, 2008), leading to the recently raised idea that privacy is severely hanging with threat. The authors are of the opinion that legislation and regulation may be one of the best and effective techniques for protecting privacy in the twenty-first century, but it is not currently adequate (Wacks, 2012). One of the solutions lies in technology design.Research limitations/implications – The aspects of privacy and data protection in the European Union have been widely discussed recently because of their broad applicability. Therefore, it is hardly possible to review and cover all the important aspects of the issue. This article focuses on the roles of technology and legislation in securing privacy. The authors examine and provide their own views based on the critical analysis of the outstanding scientific material.Practical implications – The authors highlight the ongoing change of perception of privacy. If regulation is left behind the development of technology, privacy will hardly stay alive. On the other hand, if legislation is applied on an ex-ante basis, technological development will depend on the legislators. The balance of both may be the golden means and it basically depends on the coordinated behavior of all the stakeholders.Value – The article emphasizes that the rising role of sharp development of technology by itself does not violate privacy. It is the people using this technology and the policies they carry out that create violations (Garfinkel, 2000). In fact, threats, in the first instance, are the consequences of human behavior. In other words, technology can be a significant factor of violating or demolishing privacy, however, it may also be the major method of protecting it. The balance of both may be the key means.Research type – general review.'),

However, the data collected using these technologies are often very personal—indeed, the value of the data is often directly related to how personal they are. At the same time, driven by the replication crisis, there is a sustained push to publish data to open repositories. These movements are in fundamental conflict. In this article, we propose a way to navigate this issue. We argue that there are significant advantages to be gained by ceding the ownership of data to the participants who generate the data. We then provide desiderata for a privacy-preserving platform. In particular, we suggest that researchers should use an interface to perform experiments and run analyses, rather than observing the stimuli themselves. We argue that this method not only improves privacy but will also encourage greater compliance with good research practices than is possible through open repositories. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

We argue that conventional patient consent protocols no longer work. Indeed robots that replace human surgeons take on an extraordinary level of responsibility. Surgeons undergo years of training and peer review in a strongly regulated environment, and derive trust via a patient''s faith in the hospital system. Robots on the other hand derive trust differently, via the integrity of the software that governs their operation. From a privacy perspective, there are two fundamental shifts. First, the threat model has shifted from one where the humans involved were untrusted to one where the robotic software is untrusted. Second, the basic unit of privacy control is no longer a medical record, but is replaced by four new basic units: the subject on which the robot is taking action; the tools used by the robot; the sensors (i.e data) the robot can access; and, finally access to monitoring and calibration services which afford correct operation of the robot. We suggest that contextual privacy provides useful theoretical tools to solve the privacy problems posed by surgical robots. However, it also poses some challenges: not least that the complexity of the contextual-privacy policies, if rigorously specified to achieve verification and enforceability, will be exceedingly high to directly expose to humans that review contextual privacy policies. A medical robot works with both information and physical material. While informational norms allow for judgements about contextual integrity and the transmission principle governs the constraints applied on information transfer, nothing is said about material property. Certainly, contextual privacy provides an anchor for useful notions of privacy in this scenario and thus should be considered to be extended to cover both information and material flows.'),

The use of Information Technology tools in obtaining data of people''s everyday life from various autonomous data sources allowing unrestricted access to user data has emerged as an important practical issue and has given rise to legal implications. Various innovative models for data sharing and management have privacy and centrality issues. To alleviate these limitations, we have incorporated blockchain in user modeling. In this paper, we constructed a decentralized data sharing architecture with MultiChain blockchain in the travel domain, which is also applicable to other similar domains including education, health, and sports. Businesses that operate in the tourism industries including travel and tour agencies, hotels and resorts, shopping malls are connected to the MultiChain and they share their user profile data via stream in the MultiChain. The paper presents the hotel booking service for an imaginary hotel as one of the enterprise nodes, which collects user profile data with proper validation and will allow users to decide which of their data to be shared thus ensuring user control over their data and the preservation of privacy. The data from the repository is converted into an open data format while sharing via stream in the blockchain so that other enterprise nodes, after receiving the data, can easily convert them and store into their own repositories. The paper presents an evaluation of the performance of the model by measuring the latency and memory consumption with three test scenarios that mostly affect the user experience. The node responded quickly in all of these cases.

With this in mind, many developers market their products with a focus on privacy in order to gain user trust, yet privacy tensions arise with the growing adoption of these devices and the risk of inappropriate data practices in the smart home (e.g., secondary use of collected data). Therefore, it is important for developers to consider individual user preferences and how they would change under varying circumstances, in order to identify actionable steps towards developing user trust and exercising privacy-preserving data practices. To help achieve this, we present the design and evaluation of machine learning models that predict (1) personalized allow/deny decisions for different information flows involving various attributes, purposes, and devices (AUC .868), (2) what circumstances may change original decisions (AUC .899), and (3) how much (US dollars) one may be willing to pay or receive in exchange for smart home privacy (RMSE 12.459). We show how developers can use our models to derive actionable steps toward privacy-preserving data practices in the smart home.'),

Given the numerous known attacks for TLS 1.2, it was imperative to change and even redesign the protocol in order to address them. In August 2018, a new version of the protocol, TLS 1.3, was standardized by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). TLS 1.3 not only benefits from stronger security guarantees, but aims to protect the identities of the server and client by encrypting messages as soon as possible during the authentication. In this paper, we model the privacy guarantees of TLS 1.3 when parties execute a full handshake or use a session resumption, covering all the handshake modes of TLS. We build our privacy models on top of the one defined by Hermans et al. for RFIDs (Radio Frequency Identification Devices) that mostly targets authentication protocols. The enhanced models share similarities to the Bellare-Rogaway AKE (Authenticated Key Exchange) security model and consider adversaries that can compromise both types of participants in the protocol. In particular, modeling session resumption is non-trivial, given that session resumption tickets are essentially a state transmitted from one session to another and such link reveals information on the parties. On the positive side, we prove that TLS 1.3 protects the privacy of its users at least against passive adversaries, contrary to TLS 1.2, and against more powerful ones.'),

Recently, novel variants of (A)DP focused on giving tighter privacy bounds under continual observation. In this paper we unify many previous works via the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of a mechanism. We show that for non-adaptive mechanisms, the privacy loss under sequential composition undergoes a convolution and will converge to a Gauss distribution (the central limit theorem for DP). We derive several relevant insights: we can now characterize mechanisms by their privacy loss class, i.e., by the Gauss distribution to which their PLD converges, which allows us to give novel ADP bounds for mechanisms based on their privacy loss class; we derive exact analytical guarantees for the approximate randomized response mechanism and an exact analytical and closed formula for the Gauss mechanism, that, given ε, calculates δ, s.t., the mechanism is (ε, δ)-ADP (not an over-approximating bound).'),

First, we reverse engineer numerous Continuity protocol message types and identify data fields that are transmitted unencrypted. We show that Continuity messages are broadcast over BLE in response to actions such as locking and unlocking a device’s screen, copying and pasting information, making and accepting phone calls, and tapping the screen while it is unlocked. Laboratory experiments reveal a significant flaw in the most recent versions of macOS that defeats BLE Media Access Control (MAC) address randomization entirely by causing the public MAC address to be broadcast. We demonstrate that the format and content of Continuity messages can be used to fingerprint the type and Operating System (OS) version of a device, as well as behaviorally profile users. Finally, we show that predictable sequence numbers in these frames can allow an adversary to track Apple devices across space and time, defeating existing anti-tracking techniques such as MAC address randomization.

To comply with legal requirements, app developers are often obligated to notify users of their privacy practices in privacy policies. However, prior research has suggested that many developers are not accurately disclosing their apps’ privacy practices. Evaluating discrepancies between apps’ code and privacy policies enables the identification of potential compliance issues. In this study, we introduce the Mobile App Privacy System (MAPS) for conducting an extensive privacy census of Android apps. We designed a pipeline for retrieving and analyzing large app populations based on code analysis and machine learning techniques. In its first application, we conduct a privacy evaluation for a set of 1,035,853 Android apps from the Google Play Store. We find broad evidence of potential non-compliance. Many apps do not have a privacy policy to begin with. Policies that do exist are often silent on the practices performed by apps. For example, 12.1% of apps have at least one location-related potential compliance issue. We hope that our extensive analysis will motivate app stores, government regulators, and app developers to more effectively review apps for potential compliance issues.

In this article, we propose a new scheme based on dynamic pseudonym swap zone, to protect location privacy of vehicles. For each vehicle, dynamic pseudonym swap zone allows it dynamically to establish a temporary pseudonym swap zone on demand to exchange the pseudonym with another random vehicle in the just formed zone. This randomness of choosing the pseudonym exchanging vehicles prevents dynamic pseudonym swap zone from the secure risk that the information of exchanging participants exposes to their group manager in some existing works in which each pair of pseudonym exchanging participants is assigned by the manager. To avoid the high communication and computation overhead of frequently swapping pseudonyms, dynamic pseudonym swap zone adopts a combination of swap and update to achieve the unlinkability between new and previous pseudonyms. Moreover, dynamic pseudonym swap zone can self-adapt to the varying surroundings to reduce the communication cost of forming pseudonym swap zones in high vehicle density areas. The analysis and simulation results show that our proposed dynamic pseudonym swap zone is a high location privacy preserving, secure, auditable scheme.

Maintaining the topology results in a large amount of energy overhead, and in many cases, the user is interested only in the aggregated query results of some areas in the network, and thus, the participation of the entire network node is not necessary. Aiming to solve this problem, this article proposes a spatial range aggregation query algorithm for a dynamic sensor network with privacy protection (energy-efficient privacy-preserving data aggregation). The algorithm does not rely on the pre-established topology but considers only the query area that the user is interested in, abandoning all nodes to participate in distributing the query messages while gathering the sensory data in the query range. To protect node data privacy, Shamir’s secret sharing technology is used to prevent internal attackers from stealing the sensitive data of the surrounding nodes. The analysis and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of energy and privacy protection.

Within these services, location privacy issues have captured significant attention. Vehicles use the technology of anonymity to implement occultation, the location is not revealed. In this process, large-scale data transmissions can reduce the quality of services. In order to ensure location privacy and high-quality services, the cloud manager customizes virtual machines for vehicles to support location-based services according to the vehicles’ demands. To achieve better performance, this article presents a conditional anonymity method that does not use bilinear pairings to address the problem of privacy disclosure by using discrete logarithm problem and Diffie–Hellman problem. Moreover, asymmetric key algorithms are used in the Internet of vehicles environment to reduce the cost. To guarantee secure data transmission in Internet of vehicles, the batch validation technique is used to address data integrity. Our theoretical security analysis and experiments show that the proposed scheme is secure in compared attack models, such as impersonation attacks, replay attacks, the man-in-the-middle attacks, and so on. Our proposed scheme ensures the security requirements such as message authentication, location privacy protection, and traceability, while lowering transmission and computation cost.

For achieving more compact representation of image content sensitiveness (privacy), two approaches are developed: 1) a deep network is adapted to extract 1024-D discriminative deep features; and 2) a deep multiple instance learning algorithm is adopted to identify 280 privacy-sensitive object classes and events. Second, users on the social network are clustered into a set of representative social groups to generate a discriminative dictionary for user trustworthiness characterization. Finally, both the image content sensitiveness and the user trustworthiness are integrated to train a tree classifier to recommend fine-grained privacy settings for social image sharing. Our experimental studies have demonstrated both the efficiency and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. (AN: edseee.8249924), Database: IEEE Xplore Digital Library'),

Privacy by Design (PbD) approach has been proposed to address this issue and has been applied to systems development in a variety of application domains. The aim of this work is to determine the presence of PbD and its extent in software development efforts. A systematic mapping study was conducted in order to identify relevant literature that collects PbD principles and goals in software development as well as methods and/or practices that support privacy aware software development. 53 selected papers address PbD mostly from a theoretical perspective with proposals validation based primarily on experiences or examples. The findings suggest that there is a need to develop privacy-aware methods to be integrated at all stages of software development life cycle and validate them in industrial settings.

However, as the professional activities of reporting and publishing are increasingly conducted by digital means, computer security and privacy risks threaten free and independent journalism around the globe. Through interviews with 15 practicing journalists and 14 organizational stakeholders (supervising editors and technologists), we reveal the distinct - and sometimes conflicting-computer security concerns and priorities of different stakeholder groups within journalistic institutions, as well as unique issues in journalism compared to other types of organizations. As these concerns have not been deeply studied by those designing computer security practices or technologies that may benefit journalism, this research offers insight into some of the practical and cultural constraints that can limit the computer security and privacy practices of the journalism community as a whole. Based on these findings, we suggest paths for future research and development that can bridge these gaps through new tools and practices.

The risk of privacy leakage is also increasing. In order to protect the user''s trajectory privacy in the location service, we have designed a trajectory privacy protection method with several properties in the fog-based architecture. Fog computing extends the capabilities of cloud computing to the edge of the network, with local computing and storage capabilities, and a wide geographical mobility. Therefore, this paper uses the fog server instead of the traditional TTP anonymous server in the location-based privacy protection to solve the problem that performance bottleneck and concentrated attack in the TTP server anonymity process, and then completes our design with several properties through the fog server. The TRT algorithm implements k-anonymity of the trajectory. Finally, experimental analysis proves that our method can effectively enhance the user''s trajectory privacy.

However, security and privacy issues in smart grids need to be addressed. If the user’s electricity consumption is transmitted in plaintext, the data may be used by some illegal users. At the same time, malicious users may send false data such that the control center makes a wrong power resource scheduling. In addition, efficiency issues should be taken into account in Internet of things applications. To overcome these challenges, an efficient and privacy-preserving certificateless data aggregation scheme is proposed for Internet of things–enabled smart grids. The confidentiality and integrity of data can be guaranteed, and the identity of users can be hidden in our scheme. In particular, if some users have malicious behaviors, they will be tracked. The proposed scheme can resist replay attacks, modification attacks, and impersonation attacks. In the process of collecting data, computation of encryption and signature generation do not need expensive bilinear pairings. Furthermore, batch verification is used to improve efficiency of verification. It is demonstrated that the security, privacy, and efficiency issues in smart grid are addressed based on security and performance analysis.

Facial recognition, while providing new potentials fo r safety and security and personalized marketing by retailers implicates complicated questions about the nature of consumer privacy and surveillance where a "collection imperative '''' incentivize corporate actors to accumulate increasingly massive reservoirs of consumer data. However, the law has not yet fully developed to address the unique risks to consumers through the use of this technology. This Note examines existing regulatory mechanisms, finding that consumer sensitivities and the opaque nature of the technology have resulted in over- and underinclusive regulatory regimes. This Note proposes that the broad implications of biometric privacy harms justify more extensive privacy regulation than a narrow focus on data security and self-regulation. It suggests that regulation predicated on consumer data self-management is inefficient in controlling the flow of information generated by facial recognition. This Note finds that a regulatory approach based in collaborative governance may be better suited for regulating complex systems that create hard-to-calculate risks, change too quickly fo r traditional regulatory approaches, and involve technical and industry expertise that regulators and legislators are unlikely to have.

Not only humans but machines also contribute to data in the form of closed circuit television streaming, web site logs, etc. Tons of data is generated every minute by social media and smart phones. The voluminous data generated from the various sources can be processed and analyzed to support decision making. However data analytics is prone to privacy violations. One of the applications of data analytics is recommendation systems which is widely used by ecommerce sites like Amazon, Flip kart for suggesting products to customers based on their buying habits leading to inference attacks. Although data analytics is useful in decision making, it will lead to serious privacy concerns. Hence privacy preserving data analytics became very important. This paper examines various privacy threats, privacy preservation techniques and models with their limitations, also proposes a data lake based modernistic privacy preservation technique to handle privacy preservation in unstructured data.

I first unpack the mainstream, autonomy‐centric discourse of privacy, and then present a research model that illustrates a possible new theorization of the relationship between self‐identity and information privacy. An empirical study with Facebook users confirms the main hypotheses. In particular, the data show that the need for self‐identity is positively related to privacymanagement behaviors, which in turn result in increased self‐disclosure in online social networks. I subsequently argue that the so‐called "privacy paradox" is not a paradox per se in the context of online social networking; rather, privacy concerns reflect the ideology of an autonomous self, whereas social construction of self‐identity explains voluntary self‐disclosure.

The problem is motivated by the anonymization network Tor, and the difficulties that arise when aiming to estimate the number of Tor users. We present a way to perform distributed user counting with accurate estimates and a high level of privacy protection, based on a probabilistic data structure. We start from a relatively naive approach, and analyze the level of privacy protection that it provides. Subsequently, we improve on this baseline mechanism, building upon the gained insights. In order to assess the privacy properties of the discussed techniques, we use a novel probabilistic analysis approach which compares an attacker’s a priori and a posteriori knowledge.'),

To do so, a meta-analytic approach was chosen. A literature review produced a sample of 61 effect sizes from 37 independent studies (N = 16,159,261). Results showed that females on social network sites displayed higher privacy concerns and behaviors than did males. The gender differences, while all pointing to females being more committed to enhancing privacy, were small and statistically heterogeneous. A clear gender difference was apparent for activating privacy settings (d = 0.35) and untagging photographs (d = 0.26), whereas privacy concerns (d = 0.13) and disclosure of personal information (d = 0.13) showed smaller gender differences. The findings are in line with both evolutionary and social role theories and may be explained by differences in personality, threat vulnerability, or SNS activity levels. Advocators of SNS privacy should target males as the more vulnerable segment to privacy breaches. Additional studies are needed to investigate the moderating effects of variables such as culture and age, and to clarify the basis of this gender difference. Highlights • A meta-analysis assessed gender differences in privacy on social network sites. • 61 effect sizes based on 16,159,261 users were evaluated. • Females displayed higher privacy concerns and behaviors than did males. • Females were more likely to activate privacy settings and untag photos.

However, these applications often require users to contribute, consciously or unconsciously, location-related data for analysis, which gravely encroaches users’ location privacy. Aggregate processing is a feasible way for preserving user privacy to some extent, and based on the mode, some privacy-preserving schemes have been proposed. However, existing schemes still cannot guarantee users’ location privacy in the scenarios with low density participants. Meanwhile, user accountability also needs to be considered comprehensively to protect the system against malicious users. In this paper, we propose data aggregate statistics schemes with participant density-independent location privacy-protection for mobile crowd-sensing applications. First, we make use of multi-pseudonym mechanism to overcome the vulnerability due to low participant density. Then, to further handle sybil attacks, we propose two schemes based on the Paillier cryptosystem. In the basic scheme, we leverage non-interactive zero-knowledge proof technology to verify users’ sensing data. In the advanced scheme, we present a novel verification framework, which also addresses the problem of user accountability, but at the cost of introducing a new entity. Finally, the theoretical analysis indicates that our scheme achieves the desired properties, and the performance experiments demonstrate that our scheme can achieve a balance among accuracy, privacy-protection and computational overhead.'),

Using data from a national-wide survey, this study takes a psychological approach and uses the rational fatalism theory to explain the privacy paradox on the Internet and the social networking sites (SNSs). The rational fatalism theory argues that risks will become rational if the person believes he or she has no control over the outcome. Our results support the rational fatalism view. We found that people with higher levels of fatalistic belief about technologies and business are less likely to protect their privacy on the Internet in general, and the SNS in particular. Moreover, such relationship is stronger among young Internet users compared with older users.'),

Understanding privacyconcerns enables improved service and system development and identification of appropriate data management solutions that contribute to data subjects'' privacy protection, as well as efficient utilisation of the collected data. This study aimed to explore earlier research findings on privacy concerns evaluation and investigate their validity in mobility data collection. Explorative multimethod research was conducted in a mobility service pilot through data controller interviews, user interviews and a user survey. The study''s results indicated the need to revise and complement existing privacy concerns evaluation in mobility data collection contexts. The primary findings were as follows: (1) Privacy concerns specific to the mobility data collection context exist. (2) Privacyconcerns may change during the service use. (3) Users are not necessarily personally worried about their privacyalthough they ponder on privacy issues. (4) In contrast to traditional ''privacy calculus'' thinking, users'' expected benefits from data disclosure may also be driven by altruistic motives.'),

Nevertheless, mining crucial patterns is even more appropriate than frequent patterns over transactional data streams, because crucial patterns are the subset of frequent patterns with the minimum storage cost and information lossless extraction. In this paper, we argue that the privacy of mining crucial patterns from data streams (i.e., aggregating information from individuals) is more likely to be leaked than static scenarios, due to successive releases. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little work on differential privacy in continuously publishing crucial patterns from data streams. To this end, this paper proposes a real-time differentially private crucial pattern computation algorithm which designs a three-phase mechanism (i.e., the preprocessing phase, the deep-going calculation phase, and the noise-mining phase) at every timestamp. The algorithm is able to not only improve the utility of the crucial pattern statistics as much as possible which satisfy differential privacy, but also reduce the average mining time without incurring high maintenance cost according to the feature of crucial patterns. To reduce the number of calls to crucial pattern computation algorithm, we design two-dissimilarity formulas according to the relationship between frequent patterns and crucial patterns to decide to return either low noisy statistic or accurately approximated statistic in the first two phases. When the low noisy statistic needs to be turned, the algorithm goes into the noise-mining phase. To obtain private crucial patterns, we first filter crucial pattern candidate set by perturbing the scoring functions, and then add independent Laplace noise to their supports. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on dense datasets and sparse datasets to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.'),

We studied these mechanisms by testing a 4-level model that we suggested. In the study, we used computer-modified photos of places in parks. We conducted an analysis of the correlation with Pearson''s r coefficient and a number of analyses of the mediation effects. The nature of the interactions assumed in the model has been confirmed. In terms of the relation between the accessibility of a particular space and the user''s preferences the following intermediaries are noted: first, the feeling of being out of control and then the sense of privacy and danger. In addition, the negative correlations between danger and preference are reduced when excluding the impact of privacy, and the positive correlations between privacyand preference are reduced when excluding the impact of danger. Our findings modify the idea that vegetation in parks should be shaped so that it does not provide hiding places for potential criminals. In places where the threat of crime is low, leaving hidden places that fulfil the need for privacy is in line with the users'' preferences.'),

We test our model with a sample of 244 Facebook users, finding support for the proposed relationships and yielding the following contributions. First, this research provides a novel positioning of perceived IM affordances as a primary driver of both perceived social benefits and IM disclosure propensity.

The simplicial depth is a ranking function which is frequently used in order to sort a multivariate dataset. In the higher dimension d, no better algorithm is known than the brute force method which takes Θ(nd+ 1) time, where |S| = n. Unfortunately, in contrast to the many advantages that have been previously identified by research studies, this depth function requires a massive amount of computation particularly for higher dimensional datasets. This challenge could be overcome by offloading the computation to cloud servers. However, delegating simplicial depth queries to not fully trusted cloud servers would be a source of serious security breaches and privacy issues. Therefore, in this paper, we target the privacy-preserving simplicial depth query over collaborative cloud servers. To this end, two resource-abundant cloud servers will be employed to perform such time consuming computation while maintaining the user’s privacy. Security analysis shows our proposed scheme achieves privacy-preserving requirements. In addition, some experiments based on a dataset generated by normal distribution are conducted, and the results validate the efficiency and practicality of our proposed scheme.

But as the shared data may contain private information of data owner, it has a high risk of revealing data owner''s privacy. Data obfuscation is proposed to gain a balance between data privacy and data usability. But it is hard for the present obfuscation schemes to remain the usability of data in a fine-grained level. Besides, the original data can''t be retrieved from the obfuscated data. To address the above issues, we proposed a data obfuscation scheme that adds an accurate "noise" to the original data to protect the privacy while keeping the numeral characteristics of data unchanged in different levels. Besides, the scheme can also lower the impact on data mining. Furthermore, by allocating different keys to users, different users have different permissions to access to data. To achieve this, our scheme comes in four steps. Firstly, an improved cloud model is proposed to generate an accurate "noise". Next, an obfuscation algorithm is propose to add noise to the original data. Then, an initial scheme for dataset obfuscation is proposed, including the grouping and key allocating processes. In the final step, a fine-grained grouping scheme based on similarity is proposed. The experiments show that our scheme obfuscates date correctly, efficiently, and securely.'),

However, improper additive noise could result in bias for the aggregate result. It demands an optimal noise distribution to reduce the deviation. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework to derive the optimal noise distribution that provides privacy protection under the constraint of a limited value deviation. Specifically, we first derive a generic system dynamic function that the optimal noise distribution must satisfy, and further investigate two special cases for the distribution of the original value (i.e., Gaussian and Truncated Gaussian distribution). Our theoretical analysis suggests that the Gaussian distribution is the optimal solution for the Gaussian input, and can be regarded as the optimal solution for the truncated Gaussian input under some suitable conditions.'),

However, duplicate records in a distributed dataset may lead to incorrect statistical results. Therefore, to increase the accuracy of the statistical analysis of a distributed dataset, secure deduplication is an important preprocessing step.Methods: We designed a secure protocol for the deduplication of horizontally partitioned datasets with deterministic record linkage algorithms. We provided a formal security analysis of the protocol in the presence of semi-honest adversaries. The protocol was implemented and deployed across three microbiology laboratories located in Norway, and we ran experiments on the datasets in which the number of records for each laboratory varied. Experiments were also performed on simulated microbiology datasets and data custodians connected through a local area network.Results: The security analysis demonstrated that the protocol protects the privacy of individuals and data custodians under a semi-honest adversarial model. More precisely, the protocol remains secure with the collusion of up to N - 2 corrupt data custodians. The total runtime for the protocol scales linearly with the addition of data custodians and records. One million simulated records distributed across 20 data custodians were deduplicated within 45 s. The experimental results showed that the protocol is more efficient and scalable than previous protocols for the same problem.Conclusions: The proposed deduplication protocol is efficient and scalable for practical uses while protecting the privacy of patients and data custodians.'),

We ask: How do refugees use and rely on technology as they settle in the US? What computer security and privacy practices do they have, and what barriers do they face that may put them at risk? And how are their computer security mental models and practices shaped by the advice they receive? We study these questions through in-depth qualitative interviews with case managers and teachers who work with refugees at a local NGO, as well as through focus groups with refugees themselves. We find that refugees must rely heavily on technology (e.g., email) as they attempt to establish their lives and find jobs; that they also rely heavily on their case managers and teachers for help with those technologies; and that these pressures can push security practices into the background or make common security "best practices" infeasible. At the same time, we identify fundamental challenges to computer security and privacy for refugees, including barriers due to limited technical expertise, language skills, and cultural knowledge-for example, we find that scams as a threat are a new concept for many of the refugees we studied, and that many common security practices (e.g., password creation techniques and security questions) rely on US cultural knowledge. From these and other findings, we distill recommendations for the computer security community to better serve the computer security and privacy needs and constraints of refugees, a potentially vulnerable population that has not been previously studied in this context.'),

Disempowered populations often experience disparate harms from the loss of privacy but, typically, have a limited role in formulating the scope and nature of such interventions, and accompanying (implicit or explicit) privacy policies and consequent engineering processes. This gap can be addressed by including recipient communities in designing these privacy policies. We propose a participatory design model for data-centric applications where privacy policies (norms) emerge out of participation of the community in the research/design process. The framework of Contextual Integrity which articulates privacy as respect for normative rules of information flow in specific contexts, lends itself well to enable a community-generated formulation of these privacy norms within the contexts of the proposed intervention. Employing formal logic, these privacy norms can then be used to engineer systems capable of regulating the flow of information as per the negotiated norms [1]. This entire process which we call Contextualized Participatory Privacy by Design, seeks to empower communities in negotiating and articulating their privacy norms, leading to the development of systems that are capable of enforcing what they deem as ethical, contextualized use of their data.'),

Since releasing individual’s mobility records usually gives rise to privacy issues, data sets owners tend to only publish aggregated mobility data, such as the number of users covered by a cellular tower at a specific timestamp, which is believed to be sufficient for preserving users’ privacy. However, in this paper, we argue and prove that even publishing aggregated mobility data could lead to privacy breach in individuals’ trajectories. We develop an attack system that is able to exploit the uniqueness and regularity of human mobility to recover individual’s trajectories from the aggregated mobility data without any prior knowledge. By conducting experiments on two real-world data sets collected from both the mobile application and cellular network, we reveal that the attack system is able to recover users’ trajectories with an accuracy of about 73%~91% at the scale of thousands to ten thousands of mobile users, which indicates severe privacy leakage in such data sets. Our extensive analysis also reveals that by generalization and perturbation, this kind of privacy leakage can only be mitigated. Through the investigation on aggregated mobility data, this paper recognizes a novel privacy problem in publishing statistic data, which appeals for immediate attentions from both the academy and industry.'),

The advances in such wearable devices allow healthcare service providers to easily collect a vast amount of health lifelogs from diverse users for the purpose of data analysis. However, collecting health information of individual users indiscriminately may lead to serious privacy issues, because health lifelog data usually contain sensitive information. Thus, in this paper, we develop methods capable of collecting sensitive health lifelogs from a smartwatch, which is the most popular wearable device, while protecting the data privacy of smartwatch users. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve an effective tradeoff between the degree of privacy protection and the accuracy in aggregate statistics. A correlation coefficient with an absolute value ranging from 0.808 to 0.945 between the degree of privacy protection and the accuracy in aggregate statistics can be accomplished using the proposed methods.'),

However, in case of privacy-preserving data mining, the data provider may not want to disclose sensitive data directly to the third party. Therefore, it is very important to compute chi-square test statistics and contingency coefficients, which are statistically very useful, while not disclosing original sensitive data. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to securely compute chi-square test statistics and contingency coefficients by using secure scalar products and proposing secure bitmap string operations. We prove the correctness and secureness of the proposed solution by presenting a formal theorem. Also, we empirically show the superiority and practicality of the proposed method.'),

Current users of mobile apps are normally sharing their location which is being stored by the service providers, either for internal use, to be sold later to third party companies, or to be released for public use as open data. The last two uses require the data to be stripped of information of individuals so it cannot allow identification; however, if the location is not altered sufficiently, it still could be used to find a single person. In the literature there are many location privacy protection mechanisms — LPPMs, usually expected to be applied on real time over the location information. This work introduces VoKA, a, offline privacy protection technique that focuses at the moment in which the data is released outside a protected environment, proposing a new aggregation mechanism based on Voronoi diagrams and K anonymity that preserves geographical value of the data like density and geographical distribution. The study uses Twitter data from the Lombardia area of Italy, and compares unaltered data, obfuscated data, grid-based aggregation and VoKA. Results show that VoKA can aggregate data in a more organic manner than grid-based data, and reduces the possibility to identify individuals compared to simple location obfuscation, in geostatistical analysis techniques like entropy and heatmap.'),

It has been commonly used to study the effectiveness of medical treatments or the lifespan of a population. However, survival analysis can potentially leak confidential information of individuals in the dataset. The state-of-the-art techniques apply ad-hoc privacy-preserving mechanisms on publishing results to protect the privacy. These techniques usually publish sanitized and randomized answers which promise to protect the privacy of individuals in the dataset but without providing any formal mechanism on privacy protection. In this paper, we propose private mechanisms for parametric survival analysis with Weibull distribution. We prove that our proposed mechanisms achieve differential privacy, a robust and rigorous definition of privacy-preservation. Our mechanisms exploit the property of local sensitivity to carefully design a utility function which enables us to publish parameters of Weibull distribution with high precision. Our experimental studies show that our mechanisms can publish useful answers and outperform other differentially private techniques on real datasets.'),

In this method, attributes are probabilistically randomized and then reconstructions are performed on the basis of statistical information from perturbed data. Hence, it is expected to provide more precise statistics and more reliably preserve privacy than the traditional "k-anonymity" method.

Its success primarily depends on the total number of measurements for some sample points. If there are sufficient sample points with measurements, kriging will reflect the surface accurately. Obtaining a sufficient number of measurements can be costly and time-consuming. Thus, different companies might obtain a limited number of measurements of the same region and want to offer predictions collaboratively. However, due to privacy concerns, they might hesitate to cooperate with each other.In this paper, we propose a protocol to estimate kriging-based predictions using partitioned data from two parties while preserving their confidentiality. Our protocol also protects a client’s privacy. The proposed method helps two servers create models based on split data without divulging private data and provide predictions to their clients while preserving the client’s confidentiality. We analyze the scheme with respect to privacy, performance, and accuracy. Our theoretical analysis shows that it achieves privacy. Although it causes some additional costs, they are not critical to overall performance. Our real data-based empirical outcomes show that our method is able to offer accurate predictions even if there are accuracy losses due to privacy measures.'),

When using spectral clustering for analysis, users are either required to implement their own platforms, which requires strong data analytics and machine learning skills, or allow a third party to access and analyze their data, which may compromise their data privacy or security. Traditionally, this problem is solved by privacy-preserving data mining using randomization perturbation or secure multi-party computation. However, the existing methods suffer from the problems of inaccurate results or high computational requirements on the data owner''s side. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a new secure outsourcing data mining (SODM) paradigm, which allows data owners to encrypt their data to ensure maximum data security. After the encryption, data owners can outsource their encrypted data to data analytics service providers (i.e., data analytics agent) for knowledge discovery, with a guarantee that neither the data analytics agent nor the other parties can compromise data privacy. To allow data mining to be efficiently carried out on encrypted data, we design a secure KD-tree to index all the encrypted data. Based on the SODM framework, a secure spectral clustering algorithm is proposed. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the system for the secure outsourcing of data mining.'),

One of the interesting applications is the friend locator, in which the application server informs a user through a mobile device if some of his/her listed friends are close enough in terms of geographical locations. However, in such services, it is challenging to protect the privacy of the individual users. Previous solutions for the friend locator do not guarantee a high level of privacy and do not maintain efficiency. In this paper, we propose a dual-resolution system structure to guarantee both strong privacy and efficiency. Additionally, we use the polygon decomposition method to achieve both accuracy and flexibility. To be more specific, in the coarse resolution level, each regular mobile user uploads his/her encrypted coarse location information to a central server periodically for comparisons. If a regular mobile user is found to be in the same grid block as an active mobile user, then the friend locator procedure with a higher resolution level will be conducted. Finally, through numerical analysis and simulations, we show that the proposed system design and algorithm can achieve high privacy, efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility.'),

Although the intent is to protect individuals from improper administrative use, this hardly applies to statistical aggregates that cannot identify anybody. Abstract position statements have done little to clarify the reasoning. To counter this, the present paper points to actual statistical uses of Canada''s mortality database for individual follow-up on an unprecedented scale under conditions of strict confidentiality. The statistics serve to connect earlier causes with later harm. However, confusion still surrounds the question of whether privacy can be fundamentally violated by statistics drawn from personal records. Without wider understanding, real harm to health will compete poorly with imagined harm to privacy.'),

In recent years, the notion of differential privacy has received much attention in theoretical computer science, machine learning and statistics. It provides a rigorous and strong notion of protection for individuals’ sensitive information. A fundamental question is how to incorporate differential privacy in traditional statistical inference procedures. We study model selection in multivariate linear regression under the constraint of differential privacy. We show that model selection procedures based on penalized least squares or likelihood can be made differentially private by a combination of regularization and randomization, and we propose two algorithms to do so. We show that our privacy procedures are consistent under essentially the same conditions as the corresponding non‐privacy procedures. We also find that, under differential privacy, the procedure becomes more sensitive to the tuning parameters. We illustrate and evaluate our method by using simulation studies and two real data examples. '),

If so, they would be more credible as mentors. Methods: We surveyed faculty (N = 16), 1st-year residents (N = 120), and 3rd-year medical students (N = 130) to compare attitudes about OSN and the online usage patterns.

These systems allow users to build their own custom tables, and make use of automated perturbation routines to protect confidentiality. Motivated by the growing popularity of table generating servers, in this paper we study confidentiality protection for perturbed frequency tables, including the trade-off with analytical utility, focusing on a version of the ABS TableBuilder as a concrete example of a data release mechanism, and examining its properties. Confidentiality protection is assessed in terms of the differential privacy standard, and this paper can be used as a practical introduction to differential privacy, to calculations related to its application, to the relationship between confidentiality protection and utility, and to confidentiality in general.'),

Drawing on the concept of legal consciousness, this article explores through focus group interviews the ways in which social media users negotiate privacy violations and what role their understanding of privacy laws (or lack thereof) might play in their strategies of negotiation. The findings are threefold: first, privacy is understood almost universally as a matter of controlling one’s own data, including information disclosure even to friends, and is strongly connected to issues about personal autonomy; second, a form of resignation with respect to control over personal data appears to coexist with a recognized need to protect one’s private data, while respondents describe conscious attempts to circumvent systems of monitoring or violation of privacy, and third, despite widespread coverage of privacy legal issues in the press, respondents’ concerns about and engagement in “self-protecting” tactics derive largely from being personally affected by violations of law and privacy.'),

First, privacy matters, and second, respondents identify their experiences of sharing and understandings of privacy in more traditional privacy terms: as an individualized right focused on control, pointing to a disconnect between sharing culture and concepts of privacy. Third, respondents describe their sharing behaviors as clearly shaped by privacy logics, almost entirely driven by social rather than institutional privacy. These social privacy logics are made visible through "private sharing," "public friends," and the depersonalization of shared public content. These evolving ways of navigating sharing culture point to the apparent triumph of social privacy over institutional privacy, but they also reveal a platform failure to make institutional privacy coherent in respondents'' lives.'),

The prevalence of digital technology shapes the social, political and cultural aspects of the lives of urban young adults. The influential Chinese social media platform WeChat is taken as a case study, and the ease of connection, communication and transaction combined with issues of commercialisation and surveillance are discussed in the framework of the privacy paradox. Protective behaviour and tactics are examined through different perceptions of privacy in the digital age. The findings of this study suggest that users possess certain amount of freedoms on WeChat. However, users'' individual privacy attitudes and behaviour in practice suggest they have a declined sense of their own freedom and right to privacy. A privacy paradox exists when users, while holding a high level of concerns, in reality do little to further the protection of their personal information on WeChat. We argue that once a user has ingrained part of their social engagement within the WeChat system, the incentive for them to remain a part of the system outweighs their requirement to secure their privacy online as their decision-making is largely based on a simple cost-benefit analysis. The power and social capital yielded via WeChat is too valuable to give up as WeChat is widely used not only for private conversations, but also for study or work-related purposes. It further blurs the boundaries between the public, the professional and the private, which is a rather unique case compared with other social media around the world.'),

Second, ad relevance inversely correlates with privacy concerns (i.e. descending personal control and surging corporate power) and protective behaviours (self-filtering and ad evasion). Third and finally, neither privacy concerns nor protective behaviours have a negative bearing on habitual smartphone usage. Opposite to previous research, our study concludes that Taiwanese college students exhibit zero privacy paradox, owing to no signs of privacy concern incited by mobile targeting ads, no evidence of significant protective behaviours, and no decreasing habitual smartphone usage out of privacy concern and protection.

This is especially important in spaces where privacy violations put people, particularly marginalized individuals, at risk for online harassment and abuse, among other harms. We seek to intervene in online research practices by putting forth a feminist approach to privacy, drawing on two studies related to online harassment. Specifically, we argue that feminist theory and methodology inform an approach to privacy that (a) starts from the lives of socially and politically vulnerable groups, (b) takes an intersectional approach to analyzing power relations, and (c) draws on a moral imperative of care and responsibility in enacting feminist principles of context, dialogue, and reflexivity throughout the research process.

I argue that critical scholars of surveillance and the digital economy need to address the fact that the digital economy is predicated on the subject’s non-sovereignty, where individuals can be fragmented and combined into the mass collection of data.

This paper draws upon contemporary feminist philosophy in order to consider the changing meaning of privacy and its relationship to identity, both online and offline. For example, privacy is now viewed by European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) as a right, which when breached can harm us by undermining our ability to maintain social relations. I briefly outline the meaning of privacy in common law and under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in order to show the relevance of contemporary feminist thought, in particular the image of selfhood that stresses its relationality. I argue that the meaning of privacy is in the process of altering as a result of a number of contingent factors including both changes in technology, particularly computer mediated communication (CMC), and changes in the status of women. This latter point can be illustrated by the feminist critique of the traditional reluctance of the liberal state to interfere with violence and injustice within the “privacy” of the home. In asking the question: “how is the meaning of “privacy” changing?” I consider not only contemporary legal case law but also Thomas Nagel’s influential philosophical analysis of privacy. Nagel’s position is useful because of the detail with which he outlines what privacy used to mean, whilst bemoaning its passing. I agree with his view that its meaning is changing but am critical of his perspective. In particular, I challenge his claim regarding the traditional “neutrality of language” and consider it in the context of online identity.'),

Recognizing the merits of this approach I supplement it in two respects. First, an analysis of the relation between privacy and autonomy teaches that in the digital age more than ever individual autonomy is threatened. The striking contrast between on the one hand offline vocabulary, where autonomy and individual decision making prevail, and on the other online practices is a challenge that cannot be met in a social approach. Secondly, I elucidate the background of the social approach. Its importance is not exclusively related to the digital age. In public life we regularly face privacy-moments, when in a small distinguished social domain few people are commonly involved in common experiences. In the digital age the contextual integrity model of Helen Nissenbaum has become very influential. However this model has some problems. Nissenbaum refers to a variety of sources and uses several terms to explain the normativity in her model. The notion ‘context’ is not specific and faces the reproach of conservatism. We elaborate on the most promising suggestion: an elaboration on the notion ‘goods’ as it can be found in the works of Michael Walzer and Alisdair Macintyre. Developing criteria for defining a normative framework requires making explicit the substantive goods that are at stake in a context, and take them as the starting point for decisions about the flow of information. Doing so delivers stronger and more specific orientations that are indispensible in discussions about digital privacy.'),

The privacy paradox identifies a disjuncture between what is said about privacy and what is done in practice. It refers to declarations from youth that they are highly concerned for privacy, yet frequently disregard privacy online through "oversharing" and neglecting privacy management. However, our participants, especially older teens, invoked a different mindset: that they have "nothing to hide" online and therefore do not consider privacy relevant for them.

In this paper, we propose the first privacy-preserving verifiable elastic net protocol based on reduction to support vector machine using two non-colluding servers. We construct a homomorphic cryptosystem that supports one multiply operation and multiple add operations under both single key and different keys. We allow the involved institutions to verify the correctness of the final result. The collaboration between multiple institutions is made possible without jeopardizing the privacy of data records. We formally prove that our protocol is secure and implement the protocol. The experimental results show that our protocol runs reasonably fast, and thus can be applied in practice. '),

Based on the analysis of data privacy protection situation at home and abroad, it is proposed that our country can protect data privacy by improving personnel quality, establishing relevant legal system and adopting technical prevention strategies. These strategies have certain guiding significance for exploring data privacy protection suitable for our national conditions. In order to solve the privacy protection problem in the process of large-scale network data aggregation, this paper proposes an Privacy Protection Algorithms (PPA) based on large-scale network data aggregation for the shortcomings of the existing standard large-scale network data aggregation algorithm with low time efficiency and poor reversibility. Converting the original network database into a large-scale network data aggregation form, performing network compression according to the Hamming weight of each network vector after conversion, using the matrix column vector to perform an AND operation, and calculating the support degree of the candidate set, thereby obtaining frequent itemsets. Experimental results show that compared with the original algorithm, the algorithm can improve the time efficiency while ensuring the false positive rate, has good reversibility and security, and is more practical.'),

We present EPiC, a practical protocol for the privacy-preserving evaluation of a fundamental operation on data sets: frequency counting. In an encrypted outsourced data set, a cloud user can specify a pattern, and the cloud will count the number of occurrences of this pattern in an oblivious manner. A pattern is expressed as a Boolean formula on the fields of data records and can specify values counting, value comparison, range counting, and conjunctions/disjunctions of field values. We show how a general pattern, defined by a Boolean formula, is arithmetized into a multivariate polynomial and used in EPiC. To increase the performance of the system, we introduce a new privacy-preserving encoding with "somewhat homomorphic" properties. The encoding is highly efficient in our particular counting scenario. Besides a formal analysis where we prove EPiC ''s privacy, we also present implementation and evaluation results. We specifically target Google''s prominent MapReduce paradigm as offered by major cloud providers. Our evaluation performed both locally and in Amazon''s public cloud with up to 1 TByte data sets shows only a modest overhead of 20 % compared to non-private counting, attesting to EPiC ''s efficiency.'),

In this paper, we investigate techniques to answer k-skyband queries with differential privacy. We first propose a general technique BBS-Priv, which accepts any differentially private spatial decomposition tree as input and leverages data synthesis to answer k-skyband queries privately. We then show that, though quite a few private spatial decomposition trees are proposed in the literature, they are mainly designed to answer spatial range queries. Directly integrating them with BBS-Priv would introduce too much noise to generate useful k-skyband results. To address this problem, we propose a novel spatial decomposition technique k-skyband tree specially optimized for k-skyband queries, which partitions data adaptively based on the parameter k and performs finer partitions on the regions that are likely to contain k-skyband results. We further propose techniques to generate a k-skyband tree over spatial data that satisfies differential privacy, and combine BBS-Priv with the private k-skyband tree to answer k-skyband queries.We conduct extensive experiments based on two real-world datasets and three synthetic datasets that are commonly used for evaluating k-skyband queries. The results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing differentially private spatial decomposition schemes and achieves high utility when privacy budgets are properly allocated.'),

Differential privacy provides a promising privacy definition for location data. It is enforced by injecting random noise into each location such that the level of privacy and utility provided by this sanitization when querying an LBS is quantified and controlled. However, the primitive differential privacy overlooks data errors, which constantly exist in real-life location data, thereby potentially deviating a specified indistinguishability. Therefore, we determine the impact of data errors on the indistinguishability to address the abovementioned issue. Then, we design an equivalent mechanism to enforce differential privacy and analyze its privacy and utility. Extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that our proposed equivalent mechanism consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art mechanisms in data utility at the same privacy level.'),

However, sharing data is complicated by important protections on the data (e.g., protections of privacy and intellectual property). The spectrum of options existing between data needing to be fully open access and data that simply cannot be shared at all is quite limited. This paper puts forth a generalized remote secure enclave as a socio-technical framework consisting of policies, human processes, and technologies that work hand in hand to enable controlled access and use of restricted data. Based on experience in implementing the enclave for computational, analytical access to a massive collection of in-copyright texts, we discuss the synergies and trade-offs that exist between software components and policy and process components in striking the right balance between safety for the data, ease of use, and efficiency.

Data anonymization approaches such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness are used for a long time to preserve privacy in published data. However, these approaches cannot be directly applicable to a large amount of data. Distributed programming framework such as MapReduce and Spark are used for big data analytics which add more challenges to privacy preserving data publishing. Recently, we identified few scalable approaches for Privacy Preserving Big Data Publishing in literature and majority of them are based on k-anonymity and l-diversity. However, these approaches require a significant improvement to reach the level of existing privacy preserving data publishing approaches, therefore, we propose Improved Scalable l-Diversity (ImSLD) approach which is the extension of Improved Scalable k-Anonymity (ImSKA) for scalable anonymization in this paper. Our approaches are based on scalable k-anonymization that uses MapReduce as a programming paradigm. We use poker dataset and synthesize big data versions of poker dataset to test our approaches. The result analysis shows significant improvement in terms of running time due to the lesser number of MapReduce iterations and also exhibits lower information loss as compared to existing approaches while providing the same level of privacy due to tight arrangement of the records in the initial equivalence class.'),

In order to cope with the correlation, an algorithm that utilizes the query division had been proposed. In this algorithm, random blocks of query context was used, so as the adversary was obfuscated and difficult to correlate the real result. However, this algorithm fails to dispose the size of each query block, as once same size blocks were obtained by the adversary continuously, so the adversary can regard them as blocks from the same query context, and then obtains the query context to correlate the discrete locations. In view of above conditions, in this paper we propose a fine granularity block division algorithm based on the conception of granularity measurement as well as granularity layer division, so with the help of collaborative users the location privacy of the user will be protected. In this algorithm, the query context will be divided into fine granularity size of information blocks that difficult to be distinguished with others, and then these blocks will be exchanged with other collaborative users to eliminate the difference in block size. In addition, as each block is divided into fine granularity size, the adversary will be difficult to correlate the discrete locations into location trajectory, so the location privacy will be protected. At last, through security analysis and experimental verification, this granularity indistinguishable algorithm is analyzed and verified at both theoretical and practical levels, which further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with other similar algorithms.'),

In response to this demand, some colleges and universities are developing big data programs and degrees (Gupta, Goul & Dinter, 2015). Yet not every university has the resources to allow for such expansion; some institutions struggle just to cover their IS core program courses. For these latter programs, awareness of the importance of privacy and privacy methods--like the application of security controls--is best integrated academically through a layered approach. Therefore, in this paper, the authors illustrate the important role that data privacy plays in the realm of big data, and suggest methods for providing a layered approach to applying big data privacy concepts to the IS2010 Model Core Curriculum.'),

To overcome this problem, data can be encrypted with the target module''s key before being transmitted to the in-vehicle network. However, this may lead to another efficiency problem. In this study, we propose a model that adopts the proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme to the in-vehicle network. This is called privacy-enhancing in-vehicle network key management (PINK). In the proposed model, the data stored in the VCU is encrypted with a master key. In addition, when the stored data is requested by a node, it is transformed into a ciphertext that can only be decrypted with the node''s key using the PRE scheme. Moreover, for the case in which a special group of nodes request the data several times, simultaneously, a group-based key management scheme i provided.

Recently, social media have become an increasingly important source of information on human-nature interactions. However, the use of advanced methods for analysing social media is still limited, and social media data are not used to their full potential. In this article, we present available sources of social media data and approaches to mining and analysing these data for conservation science. Specifically, we (i) describe what kind of relevant information can be retrieved from social media platforms, (ii) provide a detailed overview of advanced methods for spatio-temporal, content and network analyses, (iii) exemplify the potential of these approaches for real-world conservation challenges, and (iv) discuss the limitations of social media data analysis in conservation science. Combined with other data sources and carefully considering the biases and ethical issues, social media data can provide a complementary and cost-efficient information source for addressing the grand challenges of biodiversity conservation in the Anthropocene epoch. • Social media data is an emerging data source in conservation science. • Social media content and metadata contain useful information for understanding human-nature interactions in space and time. • This article provides an overview of available data sources and analysis methods together with practical examples. • We cover spatial analysis, content analysis and network analysis methods in more detail. • Data access and privacy concerns are the greatest challenges in practice.'),

Thus, they inherently have the potential to hamper user privacy and disclose sensitive information. Several works studied how neighborhood-based recommendation methods can incorporate user privacy protection. However, privacy preserving latent factor models, in particular, those represented by matrix factorization techniques, the state-of-the-art in recommender systems, have received little attention. In this paper, we address the problem of privacy preserving matrix factorization by utilizing differential privacy, a rigorous and provable approach to privacy in statistical databases. We propose a generic framework and evaluate several ways, in which differential privacy can be applied to matrix factorization. By doing so, we specifically address the privacy-accuracy trade-off offered by each of the algorithms. We show that, of all the algorithms considered, input perturbation results in the best recommendation accuracy, while guaranteeing a solid level of privacy protection against attacks that aim to gain knowledge about either specific user ratings or even the existence of these ratings. Our analysis additionally highlights the system aspects that should be addressed when applying differential privacy in practice, and when considering potential privacy preserving solutions. '),

To alleviate this problem, uncertain graph has been presented recently. The main idea of uncertain graph is converting an original graph into an uncertain form, where the friendly-correlations of the graph are associated with probabilities. However, the existing methods of uncertain graph lack rigorous guarantees of privacy and rely on the assumption of adversary''s knowledge. In this paper, we introduced a general model for constructing uncertain graphs. Then, we proposed an Uncertain Graph based on Differential Privacy algorithm (UGDP algorithm) under the general model which provides a rigorous privacy guarantee against powerful adversaries, and we define a new metric to measure privacy for different algorithms. Finally, we evaluate some uncertain algorithms in privacy and utility, the result shows that UGDP algorithm satisfies edge-differential privacy and the data utility is acceptable. The conclusions are that the UGDP algorithm has better privacy preserving than the (k,ε)-obfuscation algorithm, and better data utility than the RandWalk algorithm.'),

In addition to this, the Pufferfish framework can also be used to study existing privacy definitions. We illustrate the benefits with several applications of this privacy framework: we use it to analyze differential privacy and formalize a connection to attackers who believe that the data records are independent; we use it to create a privacy definition called hedging privacy, which can be used to rule out attackers whose prior beliefs are inconsistent with the data; we use the framework to define and study the notion of composition in a broader context than before; we show how to apply the framework to protect unbounded continuous attributes and aggregate information; and we show how to use the framework to rigorously account for prior data releases.'),

Unfortunately, moving an ICU patient’s data from the traditionally isolated hospital’s computing facilities to data grids via public networks (i.e., the Internet) makes it imperative to establish an integral and standardized security solution to avoid common attacks on the data and metadata being managed. Particular emphasis must be put on the patient’s personal data, the protection of which is required by legislations in many countries of the European Union and the world in general.

Network administrators are typically overwhelmed with large volumes of monitoring data, like SMTP and NetFlow measurements, from which it is very hard to separate between actionable and non-actionable events. In addition, they can only debug network problems using very basic tools, like ping and traceroute. In this context, intelligent correlation of measurements from different Internet locations is essential for analyzing the root cause of outages. However, correlating measurements across domains raises privacy concerns and hence is largely avoided. A possible solution to the privacy barrier is secure multi-party computation (MPC), that is, a set of cryptographic methods that enable a number of parties to aggregate private data without revealing sensitive information. In this article, we propose a distributed mechanism based on MPC for privacy-preserving correlation of NetFlow measurements from multiple ISPs, which helps in the diagnosis of network outages. We first outline an MPC protocol that can be used to analyze the scope (local, global, or semi-global) and severity of network outages across multiple ISPs. Then we use NetFlow data from a medium-sized ISP to evaluate the performance of our protocol. Our findings indicate that correlating data from several dozens of ISPs is feasible in near real time, with a delay of just a few seconds. This demonstrates the scalability and potential for real-world deployment of MPC-based schemes. Finally, as a case study we demonstrate how our scheme helped analyze, from multiple domains, the impact that Hurricane Sandy had on Internet connectivity in terms of scope and severity.

The need to protect privacy in time-series data while effectively supporting complex queries on them poses nontrivial challenges to the database community. We study the anonymization of time series while trying to support complex queries, such as range and pattern matching queries, on the published data. The conventional k-anonymity model cannot effectively address this problem as it may suffer severe pattern loss. We propose a novel anonymization model called (k, P)-anonymity for pattern-rich time series. This model publishes both the attribute values and the patterns of time series in separate data forms. We demonstrate that our model can prevent linkage attacks on the published data while effectively support a wide variety of queries on the anonymized data. We propose two algorithms to enforce (k, P)-anonymity on time-series data. Our anonymity model supports customized data publishing, which allows a certain part of the values but a different part of the pattern of the anonymized time series to be published simultaneously. We present estimation techniques to support query processing on such customized data. The proposed methods are evaluated in a comprehensive experimental study. Our results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Healthcare cloud applications need searchable encryption with the following two capabilities for protecting data privacy and access privacy: (1) the healthcare providers need to share the encrypted data with authorized users and enable querying over encrypted data, and (2) they also need to keep the query keywords and associated search operations private such that healthcare data hosting service providers cannot gain access to unauthorized content or trace and infer sensitive data stored in the healthcare cloud. This survey paper describes the notion of searchable encryption (SE) in the context of healthcare applications and characterize the SE use cases into four scenarios in healthcare. Then we provide a comprehensive overview of the four representative SE techniques: searchable symmetric encryption (SSE), public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS), attribute-based encryption with keyword search (ABKS), and proxy re-encryption with keyword search (PRES) according to different EHR retrieving scenarios and requirements. We categorize and compare the different SE schemes in terms of their security, efficiency, and functionality. The survey is designed to benefit both experienced researchers in the computer science (CS) field and non-specialists who are domain scientists or healthcare professionals with limited CS and information security background. Thus, we are in favor of technological overview of the state of art searchable encryption models and the underlying key techniques, instead of detailed proofs and constructions of the respective SE algorithms. We describe how the existing SE schemes relate to and differ from one another, and point out the connections between the SE techniques and the security and privacy requirements of healthcare applications and the open research problems.

While online social networks have become popular in recent years, social media analysis, especially from the viewpoint of computer scientists, is usually limited to the aspects of people''s behavior on specific websites and thus are considered not necessarily related to the day-to-day people''s behavior and relationships. We conduct research to bridge the gap between social scientists and computer scientists by exploring the multifacet existing social networks in organizations that provide better insights on how people interact with each other in their professional life. We describe a comprehensive study on the challenges and solutions of mining and analyzing existing social networks in enterprise. Several aspects are considered, including system issues; privacy laws; the economic value of social networks; people''s behavior modeling including channel, culture, and social inference; social network visualization in large-scale organization; and graph query and mining. The study is based on an SNA tool (SmallBlue) that was designed to overcome practical challenges and is based on the data collected in a global organization of more than 400 000 employees in more than 100 countries.

Its development has been promoted into an emerging outsourcing service by the almost unlimited powerful computing and storage capabilities from public clouds. The privacy preservation and effective utility of the outsourced sensitive information are key requirements now facing this service. All of the secure two-party computation protocols in existing solutions, however, cannot be free from the assumption of non-colluding servers under multi-server models, and thus fail to defend against some attacks from cloud service providers. For this reason, we present encrypted sequence comparison (E-SC), the first security system that works by executing encrypted sequence comparison under a single-server model. Two character sequences are encrypted by end users before outsourcing, while the encrypted character sequences are compared directly by a single cloud server to return their similarity results. To accomplish this goal, novel computable encryption algorithms are designed in this paper. Then, a collusion-resistant outsourcing is achieved using non-interactive padding, partition, and expansion mechanisms. Results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the client-side overhead is quadratic in the input number of salt values, along with an optimal server-side performance. Also, the overall runtime of our E-SC system is positively correlated with its security level, which is more practical in realistic applications.

We further demonstrate how counterfactual frameworks for causal inference developed in statistics and computer science can be used as the basis for defining and estimating the foreseeable effects of algorithmic decisions. Finally, we argue that certain patterns of foreseeable harms are unfair. An algorithmic decision is unfair if it imposes predictable harms on sets of individuals that are unconscionably disproportionate to the benefits these same decisions produce elsewhere.

This problem, which seeks for the best partition of the microdata file, is known to be NP-hard and has been tackled using many heuristic solutions. In this paper, we present the first reported fixed-structure-stochastic-automata-based solution to this problem. The newly proposed method leads to a lower value of the information loss (IL), obtains a better tradeoff between the IL and the disclosure risk (DR) when compared with state-of-the-art methods, and leads to a superior value of the scoring index, which is a criterion involving a combination of the IL and the DR. The scheme has been implemented, tested, and evaluated for different real-life and simulated data sets. The results clearly demonstrate the applicability of learning automata to the MAP and its ability to yield a solution that obtains the best tradeoff between IL and DR when compared with the state of the art.

Among the existing solutions, \epsilon-differential privacy provides the strongest privacy guarantee. Existing data publishing methods that achieve \epsilon-differential privacy, however, offer little data utility. In particular, if the output data set is used to answer count queries, the noise in the query answers can be proportional to the number of tuples in the data, which renders the results useless. In this paper, we develop a data publishing technique that ensures \epsilon-differential privacy while providing accurate answers for range-count queries, i.e., count queries where the predicate on each attribute is a range. The core of our solution is a framework that applies wavelet transforms on the data before adding noise to it. We present instantiations of the proposed framework for both ordinal and nominal data, and we provide a theoretical analysis on their privacy and utility guarantees. In an extensive experimental study on both real and synthetic data, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

If, on one hand, this makes the smartphone a powerful tool in our private and professional life, on the other hand it has brought about a series of new challenging security and privacy threats, and raised the need to protect users and their data through new secure authentication protocols. In this article, we illustrate how the security level of a human authentication system is increasing from traditional systems based on the use of passwords or badges to modern systems based on biometrics. We have moved a step forward by conceiving an authentication protocol based on the combined recognition of the human face and smartphone fingerprint. Thanks to image processing techniques, both the distinctive characteristics of the face and of the device that captures the face image can be extracted from a single photo or video frame and used for a double check of user identity. The fast technological development of smartphones allows performing sophisticated operations on the device itself. From the edge computing perspective, the burden of biometric recognition and source camera identification can be moved to the end user side. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

This system targets the increasing populations of online mobile users, e.g., smartphone users, enabling such users to provide location-based services to each other, thus enabling citizen reporter or citizen as a sensor scenarios. More specifically, the system allows users to register as service volunteers, or micro-service providers, by accepting service descriptions and periodically updated locations from such volunteers; and the system allows users to subscribe to notifications of available, nearby relevant services by accepting subscriptions, formalized as continuous queries, that take service preferences and user locations as arguments and return relevant services. Services are ranked according to their relevance and distance to a query, and the highest ranked services are returned. The key challenge addressed is that of scalably providing up-to-date results to queries when the query locations change continuously. This is achieved by the proposal of a new so-called safe-zone model. With safe zones, query results are accompanied by safe zones with the property that a query result remains the same for all locations in its safe zone. Then, query users need only notify the system when they exit their current safe zone. Existing safe-zone models fall short in the papers setting. The new model is enabled by (i) weighted and (ii) set weighted imprecise Voronoi cells. The paper covers underlying concepts, properties, and algorithms, and it covers applications in VGS tracking and presents findings of empirical performance studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

To ensure the authenticity and privacy of data, privacy-preserving truth discovery has attracted much attention since it can find reliable information among uneven quality of data collected from mobile users, while protecting both the confidentiality of users’ raw sensory data and reliability. However, these methods always incur tremendous overhead and require all participants to keep online for interacting frequently with the cloud server.

More notably, our EPTD is the first solution to resolve the problem that users must be online all times during the truth discovery under a single cloud server setting. Moreover, we design a double-masking protocol to ensure the strong security of users’ privacy even if the cloud server colludes with multiple users. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world mobile crowd sensing systems also demonstrate the high performance of our proposed scheme compared with existing models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

In this paper, we proposed a Two-Factor LIghtweight Privacy-preserving authentication scheme (2FLIP) to enhance the security of VANET communication. 2FLIP employs the decentralized certificate authority (CA) and the biological-password-based two-factor authentication (2FA) to achieve the goals. Based on the decentralized CA, 2FLIP only requires several extremely lightweight hashing processes and a fast message-authentication-code operation for message signing and verification between vehicles. Compared with previous schemes, 2FLIP significantly reduces computation cost by 100–1000 times and decreases communication overhead by 55.24%–77.52%. Furthermore, any certificate revocation list (CRL)-related overhead on vehicles is avoided. 2FLIP makes the scheme resilient to denial-of-service attack in both computation and memory, which is caused by either deliberate invading behaviors or jammed traffic scenes. The proposed scheme provides strong privacy preservation that the adversaries can never succeed in tracing any vehicles, even with all RSUs compromised. Moreover, it achieves strong nonrepudiation that any biological anonym driver could be conditionally traced, even if he is not the only driver of the vehicle. Extensive simulations reveal that 2FLIP is feasible and has an outstanding performance of nearly 0-ms network delay and 0% packet-loss ratio, which are particularly appropriate for real-time emergency reporting applications.

A more powerful adversary, which can use hidden Markov model to estimate the state of the source, is considered in this study. To cope with this type of adversary, phantom nodes and fake sources, which are responsible to mimic the behavior of the source, are utilized to diversify the routing path. Then, the weight of each node is calculated as a criterion to select the next-hop candidate. In addition, two transmission modes are designed to transmit real packets. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PSLP scheme improves the safety time without compromising the energy consumption. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Sharing these research findings with practitioners and students magnifies the impact. In pursuing these goals, however, researchers, educators, and their students must ensure that their own computing activities remain legal and ethical. Computer security professionals should be equally cautious in assisting corporate or government computer resource owners with investigations. Advances in technology often outstrip the legal system''s ability to create statutes and experience case law to test them - a process that can take many years.

The existing location privacy protection methods, which require mobile nodes to collectively change their pseudonyms in special regions called mix zones, may not work well in DTNs due to their unique characteristics, including low network density and limited contact duration. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative location privacy protection scheme, which is called AVATAR, for sparse DTNs. The main idea of AVATAR is to generate a certain number of virtual nodes in the proximity of a node and allow both virtual and real nodes to make a coordinated pseudonym change in an enlarged region, which are named virtual mix zones. Each AVATAR participant benefits from increased location privacy protection at the cost of generating a series of signed position messages, which are named footprint signatures. To stimulate each node to contribute more footprint signatures to the virtual mix zones, AVATAR proposes a reward mechanism, which is modeled as a multiunit discriminatory auction game. Extensive simulations and analysis have been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

Many existing studies employ traditional DP mechanisms (e.g., the Laplace mechanism) as primitives to continuously release private data for protecting privacy at each time point (i.e., event-level privacy), which assume that the data at different time points are independent, or that adversaries do not have knowledge of correlation between data. However, continuously generated data tend to be temporally correlated, and such correlations can be acquired by adversaries. In this paper, we investigate the potential privacy loss of a traditional DP mechanism under temporal correlations. First, we analyze the privacy leakage of a DP mechanism under temporal correlation that can be modeled using Markov Chain. Our analysis reveals that, the event-level privacy loss of a DP mechanism may increase over time. We call the unexpected privacy loss temporal privacy leakage (TPL). Although TPL may increase over time, we find that its supremum may exist in some cases. Second, we design efficient algorithms for calculating TPL. Third, we propose data releasing mechanisms that convert any existing DP mechanism into one against TPL. Experiments confirm that our approach is efficient and effective.'),

In this paper we present LPAuditor, a tool that conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the privacy loss caused by publicly available location metadata. First, we demonstrate how our system can pinpoint users'' key locations at an unprecedented granularity by identifying their actual postal addresses. Our experimental evaluation on Twitter data highlights the effectiveness of our techniques which outperform prior approaches by 18.9%-91.6% for homes and 8.7%-21.8% for workplaces. Next we present a novel exploration of automated private information inference that uncovers ''sensitive'' locations that users have visited (pertaining to health, religion, and sex/nightlife). We find that location metadata can provide additional context to tweets and thus lead to the exposure of private information that might not match the users'' intentions. We further explore the mismatch between user actions and information exposure and find that older versions of the official Twitter apps follow a privacy-invasive policy of including precise GPS coordinates in the metadata of tweets that users have geotagged at a coarse-grained level (e.g., city). The implications of this exposure are further exacerbated by our finding that users are considerably privacy-cautious in regards to exposing precise location data. When users can explicitly select what location data is published, there is a 94.6% reduction in tweets with GPS coordinates. As part of current efforts to give users more control over their data, LPAuditor can be adopted by major services and offered as an auditing tool that informs users about sensitive information they (indirectly) expose through location metadata.'),

With such consideration, the interplay between the attacker and the collaborative entities is formulated as Quantitative Information Flow (QIF) games, in which the QIF theory is adapted to measure the collaboration gain and the privacy loss of the entities in the information sharing process. In particular, three games are considered, each corresponding to one possible scenario of interest in practice.

However, the rich information contained in a photo makes it easier for a malicious viewer to infer sensitive information about those who appear in the photo. How to deal with the privacy disclosure problem incurred by photo sharing has attracted much attention in recent years. When sharing a photo that involves multiple users, the publisher of the photo should take into all related users'' privacy into account. In this paper, we propose a trust-based privacy preserving mechanism for sharing such coowned photos. The basic idea is to anonymize the original photo so that users who may suffer a high privacy loss from the sharing of the photo cannot be identified from the anonymized photo. The privacy loss to a user depends on how much he or she trusts the receiver of the photo. And the user''s trust in the publisher is affected by privacy loss. The anonymiation result of a photo is controlled by a threshold specified by the publisher. We propose a greedy method for the publisher to tune the threshold, in the purpose of balancing between the privacy preserved by anonymization and the information shared with others. Simulation results demonstrate that the trust-based photo sharing mechanism is helpful to reduce the privacy loss, and the proposed threshold tuning method can bring a good payoff to the user.'),

During this iterative process the leakage of data privacy arises. A differentially private ADMM was proposed in prior work (Zhang & Zhu, 2017) where only the privacy loss of a single node during one iteration was bounded, a method that makes it difficult to balance the tradeoff between the utility attained through distributed computation and privacy guarantees when considering the total privacy loss of all nodes over the entire iterative process. We propose a perturbation method for ADMM where the perturbed term is correlated with the penalty parameters; this is shown to improve the utility and privacy simultaneously. The method is based on a modified ADMM where each node independently determines its own penalty parameter in every iteration and decouples it from the dual updating step size. The condition for convergence of the modified ADMM and the lower bound on the convergence rate are also derived.'),

This has become more important following revelations made by Edward Snowden in 2013 regarding the collection of vast swathes of data from the Internet by signals intelligence agencies such as NSA and GCHQ. The nature of this collection is such that if the control account is correct then there has been a significant invasion of people''s privacy. If, though, the access account is correct then there has not been an invasion of privacy on the scale suggested by the control account. I argue that the control account of privacy is mistaken. However, the consequences of this are not that the seizing control of personal information is unproblematic. I argue that the control account, while mistaken, seems plausible for two reasons. The first is that a loss of control over my information entails harm to the rights and interests that privacy protects. The second is that a loss of control over my information increases the risk that my information will be accessed and that my privacy will be violated. Seizing control of another''s information is therefore harmful, even though it may not entail a violation of privacy. Indeed, seizing control of another''s information may be more harmful than actually violating their privacy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

However, releasing trajectory data without proper sanitation poses serious threats to users’ privacy. Existing work cannot achieve differential privacy perfectly because they use random and unbounded noises, which will leak users’ privacy and violate the utility of the released trajectory data. Besides, existing trajectory merging method has to remove some trajectories from the input dataset. To solve both problems, we propose a novel differentially private trajectory data publishing algorithm with a bounded noise generation algorithm and a trajectory merging algorithm. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the privacy loss of our scheme is at least 69% less; the average trajectories merging time is 50% less than existing work.'),

Their use in privacy-sensitive contexts raises the question of whether they leak private information. In particular, can they provide any privacy guarantees while preserving their strong aggregation properties? We formulate an abstract notion of cardinality estimators, which captures this aggregation requirement: one can merge sketches without losing precision. We propose an attacker model and a corresponding privacy definition, strictly weaker than differential privacy: we assume that the attacker has no prior knowledge of the data. We then show that if a cardinality estimator satisfies this definition, then it cannot have a reasonable level of accuracy. We prove similar results for weaker versions of our definition, and analyze the privacy of existing algorithms, showing that their average privacy loss is significant, even for multisets with large cardinalities. We conclude that sketches from cardinality estimators should be considered as sensitive as raw data, and propose risk mitigation strategies for their real-world applications.'),

HTTPS has been used to protect sensitive information exchanges, but security exploits such as passive and active attacks have exposed the need to implement HTTPS in a more rigorous and pervasive manner.

We argue that existing LPPMs are not capable of protecting the sensitive information in user''s spatiotemporal activities, such as ''visited hospital in the last week'' or ''regularly commuting between Address 1 and Address 2 every morning and afternoon'' (it is easy to infer that Addresses 1 and 2 may be home and office). We define such privacy as Spatiotemporal Event Privacy, which can be formalized as Boolean expressions between location and time predicates. To understand how much spatiotemporal event privacy that existing LPPMs can provide, we first formally define spatiotemporal event privacy by extending the notion of differential privacy, and then provide a framework for calculating the spatiotemporal event privacy loss of a given LPPM under attackers who have knowledge of user''s mobility pattern. We also show a case study of utilizing our framework to convert the state-of-the-art mechanism for location privacy, i.e., Planner Laplace Mechanism for Geo-indistinguishability, into one protecting spatiotemporal event privacy. Our experiments on real-life and synthetic data verified that the proposed method is effective and efficient.'),

Furthermore, to bound information leakage from the aggregates, they can perturb the input of the aggregation or its output to ensure that these are differentially private.In this paper, we set to evaluate the impact of releasing aggregate location time-series on the privacy of individuals contributing to the aggregation. We introduce a framework allowing us to reason about privacy against an adversary attempting to predict users'' locations or recover their mobility patterns. We formalize these attacks as inference problems, and discuss a few strategies to model the adversary''s prior knowledge based on the information she may have access to. We then use the framework to quantify the privacy loss stemming from aggregate location data, with and without the protection of differential privacy, using two real-world mobility datasets. We find that aggregates do leak information about individuals'' punctual locations and mobility profiles. The density of the observations, as well as timing, play important roles, e.g., regular patterns during peak hours are better protected than sporadic movements. Finally, our evaluation shows that both output and input perturbation offer little additional protection, unless they introduce large amounts of noise ultimately destroying the utility of the data.'),

First, the consent is issued cryptographically by the user over some consented specific purposes, thus it protects both the user and the service provider against possible repudiations. Second, the users’ privacy is preserved as the protocol supports untraceability over the channel, and pseudonymity with regard to the service provider. Pseudonyms are fully managed by the users themselves through suitable use of Hierarchical Identity-Based Signature (HIBS). Third, the solution is lightweight in terms of communication and computation, thus making it suitable for IoT resource constrained environments. Fourth, an illustrative car-sharing use case is presented where users are able to personalize their driving experience. Fifth, a formal validation of the protocol is provided with the AVISPA tool, along with an informal security and privacy analysis.

Through various non-intrusive load monitoring techniques, consumer behavior may be inferred from their metering data. In this paper, we propose an energy management method that reduces energy cost and protects privacy through the minimization of information leakage. The method is based on a model predictive controller that utilizes energy storage and local generation, and that predicts the effects of its actions on the statistics of the actual energy consumption of a consumer and that seen by the grid. Computationally, the method requires solving a mixed-integer quadratic program of manageable size whenever new meter readings are available. We simulate the controller on generated residential load profiles with different prices of privacy loss in a two-tier time-of-use energy pricing environment. Results show that information leakage is effectively reduced at the expense of increased energy cost. The results also show that with the proposed controller the consumer load profile seen by the grid resembles a mixture between that obtained with non-intrusive load leveling and lazy stepping.'),

Along with this, there is a serious threat to individuals'' privacy. One privacy risk comes from the sharing of co-owned data, i.e., when a user shares a data item that involves multiple users, some users'' privacy may be compromised, since different users generally have different opinions on who can access the data. How to design a collaborative management mechanism to deal with such a privacy issue has recently attracted much attention. In this paper, we propose a trust-based mechanism to realize collaborative privacy management. Basically, a user decides whether or not to post a data item based on the aggregated opinion of all involved users. The trust values between users are used to weight users'' opinions, and the values are updated according to users'' privacy loss. Moreover, the user can make a tradeoff between data sharing and privacy preserving by tuning the parameter of the proposed mechanism. We formulate the selecting of the parameter as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply the upper confidence bound policy to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the trust-based mechanism can encourage the user to be considerate of others'' privacy, and the proposed bandit approach can bring the user a high payoff.'),

As an online system evolves over time, new digital traces of individual behavior may uncover previously hidden statistical links between an individual''s past actions and her private traits. To quantify this effect, we analyze the evolution of individual privacy loss by studying the edit history of Wikipedia over 13 years, including more than 117,523 different users performing 188,805,088 edits. We trace each Wikipedia''s contributor using apparently harmless features, such as the number of edits performed on predefined broad categories in a given time period (e.g. Mathematics, Culture or Nature). We show that even at this unspecific level of behavior description, it is possible to use off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms to uncover usually undisclosed personal traits, such as gender, religion or education. We provide empirical evidence that the prediction accuracy for almost all private traits consistently improves over time. Surprisingly, the prediction performance for users who stopped editing after a given time still improves. The activities performed by new users seem to have contributed more to this effect than additional activities from existing (but still active) users. Insights from this work should help users, system designers, and policy makers understand and make long-term design choices in online content creation systems.'),

CP represents a dimension-reduced subspace design of optimally desensitized query that may be safely shared with the public. Built upon the information and estimation theory, this paper proposes a “differential mutual information” (DMI) criterion to safeguard the privacy protection (PP). Algorithmically, DMI-optimal solutions can be derived via the Discriminant Component Analysis (DCA). Moreover, DCA has two machine learning variants (one in the original space and another is the kernel space) good for supervised learning applications. By extending the notion of DMI to the utility gain and privacy loss, CP unifies the conventional Information Bottleneck (IB) and Privacy Funnel (PF) and lead to two constrained optimizers, named Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB) and Generalized Privacy Funnel (GPF). In the supervised learning environments, DCA can be further extended to a DUCA machine learning variant to reach an optimal tradeoff between utility gain and privacy loss. Finally, for fast convergence, a golden-section iterative method is developed particularly for solving the two constrained optimization problems: GIB and GPF. [All rights reserved Elsevier].'),

On the early liberal view, the exercise of autonomy requires detachment from social and political life and privacy facilitates it. This view of privacy still informs current legal and political practice. As this view of privacy presupposes a tension between privacy and society, it is responsible for the underrating of privacy in legal and political practice. Over the last decades, liberal reflection on autonomy has shifted from the early liberal understanding of autonomy as calling for detachment from social life to the idea of autonomy as socially embedded. This development has brought about a corresponding adjustment in the liberal concept of privacy: privacy has come to be seen as a social rather than merely an individual interest. The social turn in thinking about privacy has gone a long way to change the problematic image of privacy in legal and political practice. It has not gone far enough, however, to draw conclusions regarding the political relevance of privacy. I argue that we should understand autonomy as politically embedded. Revised along these lines, privacy has a political value: when we claim privacy, we do not make a claim to withdraw from political life, but rather make a claim to protect certain forms of political engagement.'),

The current research attempts to investigate support for law enforcement usage of UAS, and the factors affecting this support. / Results: Study one indicated that participants displayed significantly more support for law enforcement''s use of UAS when flying over a predominately African-American neighborhood than when flying over a primarily Caucasian neighborhood. Study two furthered these results by finding that those identifying as liberal showed less support for law enforcement UAS use, and expressed higher levels of privacy concerns than those identifying as conservative. Study three further investigated political affiliation using the Nolan Chart survey, finding that libertarians, liberals, conservatives, and authoritarians had differing levels of support and privacy concerns. / Conclusions This research adds to a foundation of understanding consumer acceptance and support for law enforcement UAS usage. As this practice becomes more common, it is important to understand support, as individual perceptions will likely influence actions. This work has numerous practical applications for policy and design. / Highlights: •Individuals unsupportive of police use of unmanned aerial systems.•Racial composition of surveilled area influences support for surveillance.•Political affiliation influenced perceptions of police use of unmanned aerial systems.•Responses indicated concerns about privacy but also noted safety benefits.'),

This article examines how demographics relate to privacy concerns and attitudes toward "political behavioral targeting" (PBT), how privacy concerns and attitudes toward PBT relate over time, and explore their relation with autonomy, electoral deliberation, and chilling effects. Using a three-wave panel study, administered in the Netherlands (N = 879), we examine a potential reciprocal relation between attitude toward PBT and privacy concerns, which may form a negative reinforcing spiral dynamic over time. This dynamic could result in undesirable behavior of the voter from a democratic viewpoint (e.g. chilling effects). We find that demographics fall short in explaining privacy concerns. More importantly, we find evidence for a reinforcing spiral dynamic and, by doing so, contribute to the discussion about the threats and promises of PBT to society. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

This is a challenge when designing tools and approaches for the use of Educational Big Data (EBD) and learning analytics (LA) in a global market. The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of information privacy in a cross-cultural setting to define a common point of reference for privacy engineering. Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows a conceptual exploration approach. Conceptual work on privacy in EBD and LA in China and the west is contrasted with the general discussion of privacy in a large corpus of literature and recent research. As much of the discourse on privacy has an American or European bias, intimate knowledge of Chinese education is used to test the concept of privacy and to drive the exploration of how information privacy is perceived in different cultural and educational settings. Findings: The findings indicate that there are problems using privacy concepts found in European and North-American theories to inform privacy engineering for a cross-cultural market in the era of Big Data. Theories based on individualism and ideas of control of private information do not capture current global digital practice. The paper discusses how a contextual and culture-aware understanding of privacy could be developed to inform privacy engineering without letting go of universally shared values. The paper concludes with questions that need further research to fully understand information privacy in education. Originality/value: As far as the authors know, this paper is the first attempt to discuss – from a comparative and cross-cultural perspective – information privacy in an educational context in the era of Big Data. The paper presents initial explorations of a problem that needs urgent attention if good intentions of privacy supportive educational technologies are to be turned into more than political slogans.

Further, online engagement has become a global phenomenon, and individuals from different cultural backgrounds discuss political and civic issues on social media. Drawing upon social exchange theory and the concept of national culture, this study aims to further explore individuals'' participation in online engagement by examining the effects of privacy and culture. We hypothesize that social capital, social media evaluation, and privacy control are positively related to online expression, while privacy risk has a negative effect on online expression. Furthermore, the effects of social capital, social media evaluation, and privacy risk and privacy control on online expression are moderated by culture. Our hypotheses are tested with survey data collected from Australia and China. The results show that social capital and social media evaluation have positive effects in all sub-samples, while privacy risk and privacy control have significant effects for the high uncertainty avoidance sub-samples. Our study contributes to the literature by clarifying the role of privacy and highlighting the importance of culture in online engagement. Public managers need to work with social media providers to better protect individuals’ privacy and take their cultural backgrounds into consideration.'),

We also argue that this defense is extensible to human social and political contexts; it provides the vital elements of a theory of just privacy infringement. This theory is broadly compatible both with major forms of political theory (except anarchistic ones) and with the main conceptions of privacy defended in recent philosophical and jurisprudential literature.

I use a factorial vignette study to examine how the introduction of formal privacy governance (privacy notices) impacts consumer trust and compare the importance of respecting informal privacy norms versus formal privacy notices on consumer trust. The results show that invoking formal privacy notices decreases trust in a website. Further, violating informal privacy norms negatively impacts trust in the website even when the information exchange conforms to or is not mentioned in the privacy notice. The results suggest that respecting privacy norms is key to trust online and challenge the reliance on privacy notices to maintain consumer trust. The consumer, who is the exchange partner most vulnerable to information asymmetries and uncertainty, is not a party to the development of the formal privacy contract and instead relies on informal privacy norms.'),

Yet, is this perception of television universally applicable? As this article argues, state socialist television was marked by a different relationship with the private-public boundary, rooted in the public thrust of the communist vision of modern society. Although television became a medium consumed in the comfort of one''s home, the narratives it offered were rarely centered exclusively on the private realm and often privileged communal and public values. The nature of televised representations of privacy in the socialist world also changed over time and differed across countries, with some countries markedly more open to depictions of privacy than others. This is demonstrated through a longitudinal and comparative investigation of domestic serial fiction covering the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The results suggest that theories of television need to pay more attention to the multiple forms of modern television cultures globally, anchored in competing visions of modern society.'),

The student is immersed in the context of Cambridge Analytica''s violation of user trust and asked to consider the key strategic issues confronting Facebook executives and the company''s ubiquitous platform. Economic concepts of a technology platform, such as network effects, switching costs, and lock-in, as well as overall platform strategy, are considered. Meanwhile, the technological concepts of designing a social media platform that engenders trust -- one that balances the conflict between privacy and personalization -- are stressed. An optional exercise on the functionality of application programming interfaces (APIs) is also provided.

We study the role of implicitly and explicitly stated prices and add new determinants such as political orientation, income proxies and membership in loyalty programmes to the analysis of privacy decision. We document large heterogeneity in privacy valuations, and that the offered monetary benefits have less predictive power for data-disclosure decisions than expected. However, we find significant predictors of such decisions, such as political orientation towards liberal democrats (FDP) and membership in loyalty programmes.

Then the theory and scoring are applied using natural language processing to rate a set of policies. The ratings are compared againsttwo benchmarks to show whether government- mandated privacy disclosures result in notices that are less ambiguous than those emerging from the market.

In this paper, we investigate how focusing on the process by which individuals make privacy choices can help explain the impact of rational and behavioral factors on privacy decision making. In an online experiment, we borrow from query-theory literature and measure individuals’ considerations (that is, queries) across manipulations of rational and behavioral factors. We find that effects of rational and behavioral factors are associated with differences in the order and valence of queries considered in privacy settings. Our results confirm that understanding how differences in privacy choice emerge can help harmonize disparate perspectives on privacy decision making.'),

Contracting between consumers and retailers operates, however, in the shadow of government efforts to deter cybercrime—which in turn can influence the equilibrium information-sharing activity levels as well as private precaution efforts taken by consumers and retailers. This article argues that there is a criminal analog to the Laffer curve. Just as citizens’ reaction to taxation policy raises the possibility that, over some range, lower tax rates may produce higher government revenues, citizens’ reaction to penal policies raises the possibility that, over some range, higher penalties may produce more crime. Though victims and thieves may be made better off by a “higher crime–higher penalty” equilibrium, these private benefits must be measured against (among other things) the social costs of additional state effort.'),

Commentators have even advocated going a step further and using simpler disclosures—warning boxes that alert consumers to the least-expected elements. But do these techniques succeed in better informing consumers or preventing unwise behavior? To answer this question, we engaged a leading market research firm to conduct a survey on risky sexual behaviors while randomizing the format of the privacy disclosures provided to the respondents. We find that best-practice simplification techniques have little or no effect on respondents’ comprehension of the disclosure, willingness to share personal information, and expectations about their rights.

Under one model of self-regulation, firms signal their privacy protections to consumers by highlighting compliance with third-party guidelines. However, in a sample of 249 policies, only 27 percent claim compliance with a specific guideline, and the policies that do claim compliance with at least one guideline are generally inconsistent with its requirements. Alternatively, under a market-based mechanism, firms incorporate consumers’ preferences directly. Consistent with this influence, there are several intuitive differences in terms across markets. Adult sites—none of which claim certification—are much more likely to give concise and clear notice of privacy practices and limit data sharing with third parties, while cloud-computing sites are particularly likely to follow stringent data security standards. Overall, privacy policy content appears to be shaped at least as much by market forces as by a self-regulatory regime based on external guidelines.'),

In addition, a significant positive relationship between socialization and political involvement positively impacts voting intentions. The study also examines the interaction effects of enculturation and acculturation orientations on the relationship between socialization and political involvement. The study''s findings point to a positive moderating role of acculturation in this relationship but a negative one for enculturation. The study is the first to investigate simultaneously the drivers of socialization on social networking sites in the context of immigrant consumers and the impact of their socialization on political involvement and voting intention.

Two underlying dimensions of privacy were revealed in the analysis: (1) perceived dangers to personal privacy and, (2) perceived dangers to institutional privacy. The analysis of associations only partially confirms the assumption of structural differences in privacy concerns, social groups being somewhat more divided regarding their concerns about institutional rather than personal privacy. Groups more concerned about regarding privacy issues had more frequent social media use as well as higher social activity. The analysis also showed that trust in institutions was related to privacy concerns of different groups and may be one of the key variables explaining the adoption of new technology in Estonia. Thus, besides new structural inequalities related to data practices online, new forms of data activisms are about to emerge, based on perceptions of personal and institutional privacy.'),

One frequent and highly criticised change has been the increasing privatisation that has occurred as part of the agenda. This has occurred in most levels of formal education. One related, but under-investigated, aspect of austerity has been the feature of privacy that has worked to enable die increasing privatisation. In this essay, we attempt to unpack how what we refer to as austerity-privacy has enabled formal education - specifically Canadian universities - to withdraw from critical public discourses. While not unrelated to privatisation, we argue that austerity-privacy was a necessary step for postsecondary education institutions to speed their neoliberal march. To illustrate this phenomenon, we examine the divestment movement in Canadian universities to illustrate the ways in which austerity-privacy obfuscates critics of neoliberal agendas. Conversely, we also examine the ways in which divestment can democratise the economy of university life. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

We produced a list of website attributes that represent these factors in a series of focus groups. Then we constructed and validated a research model from an online survey of 117 adult participants. We found that security, privacy (including awareness, information collection, and control), and reputation (including company background and consumer reviews) have a strong effect on trust and willingness to purchase, while website quality plays only a marginal role. Although the perception of trustworthiness and purchasing intention were positively correlated, in some cases participants were more willing to buy from a website that they judged as untrustworthy with regard to privacy. We investigated how behavioral biases and decision-making heuristics may explain the discrepancy between perception and behavioral intention. Finally, we determined which website attributes and individual characteristics impact customer''s trust and willingness to buy. '),

Increasing privacy protection requires decreased accuracy. Recognizing this as a resource allocation problem, we propose an economic solution: operate where the marginal cost of increasing privacy equals the marginal benefit. Our model of production, from computer science, assumes data are published using an efficient differentially private algorithm. Optimal choice weighs the demand for accurate statistics against the demand for privacy. Examples from US statistical programs show how our framework can guide decision-making. Further progress requires a better understanding of willingness-to-pay for privacy and statistical accuracy.'),

A key challenge for realizing the vision is, however, “How will the technology system handle user data?” For the user centric and data centric 5G technologies to be accepted and function as a viable business model, user trust in their data privacy is paramount. Today personal data have become an economic asset belonging to the service providers whose business case often includes and is dependent on the use and selling of such data.

While third party content and services provide value and utility to website users, this comes at the cost of user information being shared with the third party. Privacy concerns surrounding information leakage have been growing rapidly. With increasing concerns regarding online privacy and information disclosure, it is important to understand the factors that affect the level of sharing between publisher websites and third parties. In this study, we propose a two-sided economic model that captures the interaction between the users, publisher websites, and third parties. Specifically, we focus on the effect of privacy concerns on the sharing behavior of the publisher website and the impact of users’ privacy concerns on third party market concentration. We then analyze welfare aspects to provide insights on the impacts of industry regulations and policy on users, publisher websites, and third parties. We partially validate the model using an exploratory empirical analysis of publisher website third party sharing behavior and the structure of the industry. To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to analyze publisher website decision making in sharing user information with third parties.'),

For example, firms considering a merger must determine the merger''s profitability, but would prefer to keep their information private if the deal fails. In the model, agents with different traits reveal information to a potential partner to determine if they share the same type, but face a penalty depending on the accuracy of their partner''s posterior beliefs. With limited signaling, there is a universally-preferred dynamic communication protocol in which traits are sequentially revealed depending on the sensitivity of the trait. Interestingly, the rarity of an agent''s traits plays no role due to the balance of opposing effects: although revealing a rare trait reveals more information immediately, it also screens more partners from later learning information about other traits.'),

We argue that freedom is fundamental to economics and conceive privacy as a specific form of freedom. We then apply the principle that freedom cannot be ''self-defeating'' (no one is free not to be free) to privacy. This principle requires that restrictions of freedom and, by extension, privacy be revocable. We thus develop a novel concept of privacy, which leads us to evaluate privacy favorably, and apply the revocability requirement to identify unacceptable restrictions of privacy. '),

These novel consumer-to-consumer marketplaces have started to obliterate the boundaries between private and economic spheres. Marketing personal resources online is inherently associated with the disclosure of personal and sometimes intimate information. This raises unprecedented questions of privacy. Yet, there is so far little research on the role of privacy considerations in the sharing economy literature. Leveraging the theoretical perspective of privacy calculus, we address this gap by investigating how privacy concerns and economic prospects shape a potential provider''s intentions to share via different communication channels. We relate privacy concerns back to the provider''s perceptions of the audience. We evaluate our research model by means of a scenario-based online survey, providing broad support for our reasoning.'),

In particular, the computation of security investment does not consider the bilateral security risk, and the used threat models do not consider the particular aspects of privacy threats and attacks, which show the use of multiple steps to thief and misuse the information, and depend on the type of the stolen information and its lifetime.We provide in this work an economic security investment model, allowing firms, which outsource their IT business functions, to determine their optimal security investment and the related residual risk. In this work, threats on data privacy are modeled considering the particular aspects of privacy attacks. A numerical analysis is conducted to analyze the impact of the quality of detection and reaction to privacy breaches, on optimal investment and residual risk. The analysis shows that the amount of optimal investment depends on the minimal time period to detect a security breach, the ability of the customer firm to react to such an attack as quickly as possible, and also on the type of threat on private data. In particular it has been shown that for threats related to private information theft, the customer firm can take advantage from the delay in detecting attacks at the outsourcing provider side. Moreover, it should not also put a lot of security investment effort in reducing the reaction time to these privacy attacks. In the contrary, for threats related to privacy exploitation by self-propagating malware, the customer firm has not to contact with an outsourcing company which is not committed to report an attack occurrence within a short delay, and should not to put a lot of security investment effort in reducing the reaction time to these attacks.'),

However, the societal and research benefits of these networks have also given rise to potentially significant privacy issues in the sense that malicious entities may violate the privacy of the users of such a network by analyzing the network and deliberately using such privacy violations for deleterious purposes. Such considerations have given rise to a new active research area that deals with the quantification of privacy of users in large networks and the corresponding investigation of computational complexity issues of computing such quantified privacy measures. In this paper, we formalize three natural problems related to such a privacy measure for large networks and provide non-trivial theoretical computational complexity results for solving these problems. Our results show the first two problems can be solved efficiently, whereas the third problem is provably hard to solve within a logarithmic approximation factor. Furthermore, we also provide computational complexity results for the case when the privacy requirement of the network is severely restricted, including an efficient logarithmic approximation.'),

Firstly, we are the first to develop and analyse a new contracting problem in the context of personalised services in which the vendor strategically offers two complementary personalisation services to acquire customer preference information. Secondly, given heterogeneity in the willingness to use and expected utility for complementary personalisation services, we uniquely incorporate market realities about the differentiation of customer segmentation. We investigate how the boundedly rational customer segment affects the vendor''s optimal personalisation service strategies and profits. Thirdly, our study extends the privacy calculus theory in information systems through an economic model to reveal customer privacy perceptions and online behaviours. In brief, our study offers guidelines for online vendors that address online personalisation and sheds light on how to effectively carry out information acquisition strategies with boundedly rational customer issues. Market demand uncertainty and customer preference complementarity make targeted advertising and pricing decisions for online vendors particularly challenging. Advanced Internet technologies have provided vendors with the capacity to acquire customer complementary preference information. These technologies depend on the level of personalisation services and segmentation of customers. These problems get exacerbated by the fact that a vendor cannot accurately predict customer preference and thus cannot charge for online personalisation services. Therefore, designing service contracts to acquire customer preference information is vital for the vendor. This study tries to derive the optimal contracting structures (basic service, zero-utility complementary, and positive-utility complementary contracts) for vendors under information asymmetry, considering service complementarity and customer segmentation. Our study can be used in many online shopping and line-interactive systems that give the vendor a noteworthy information advantage.'),

Yet, if consumers dislike that web sites collect their personal information, their welfare may go down. We study competition for consumers between web sites that can show targeted advertisements. We find that more targeting increases competition and reduces the web sites'' profits, but yet in equilibrium web sites choose maximum targeting as they cannot credibly commit to low targeting. A privacy protection policy can be beneficial for both consumers and web sites. If consumers are heterogeneous in their concerns for privacy, a policy that allows choice between two levels of privacy will be better. Optimal privacy protection takes into account that the more intense competition on the high-targeting market segment also benefits consumers on the less competitive segment. Consumer surplus is maximized by allowing them a choice between a high-targeting regime and a low-targeting regime which affords more privacy. '),

Behavioral research suggests that consumers engage in a privacy calculus where they trade off their privacy costs from sharing information against their value from personalization. Through a formal economic model of this personalization-for-privacy (p4p) trade-off, we examine welfare implications by characterizing consumption utilities as "no-free-disposal" functions. We investigate the optimality of four regulatory regimes (through allowance/disallowance of usage-enforcing technologies, and private contracts) by analyzing the strategic interaction between a monopolist who offers personalization services "free of charge" and two consumer types--privacy and convenience seekers. While many privacy watchdog groups have called for technology restrictions and more regulation, our research broadly suggests that society is better off with assignment of property rights over their information to consumers and full allowance of technological control and contractual abilities for the monopolist. However, when private contracts are proscribed, the regulator should also prevent the deployment of usage-enforcing technologies, particularly when the market is predominantly composed of privacy seekers. Interestingly, unlike traditional price-instrument markets for goods with free disposal, a regulator should not only encourage this market''s knowledge of consumers'' p4p preferences but also the various uses and benefits of preference information to the vendor.'),

However, the platform business model presents challenges for the application of competition law. Most notably, they appear to offer consumers a great number of their products for free. The explanation for most of these supposedly free products is offered by two-sided market theory: consumers may not be paying, but the ''other'' side of the market is. This other side of the market often consists of advertisers, which pay the platform for access to the consumers'' information (to target advertisements) and attention (to show the advertisements). As many of these platforms are now potentially dominant, they come within the scope of competition law''s abuse of dominance provision, including the doctrines of predatory and excessive pricing. These price-based theories need to adapt to the often price-less platform business model in order to prevent competition authorities from making both type I and type II enforcement errors. At the same time, competition law enforcement needs to consider—and at times give priority to—other branches of law that address abusive behaviour concerning free products. Through the use of case studies, this article therefore suggests ways in which abuse of dominance assessments can take into account the economic reality of free products.'),

This problem is solved in a distributed manner, i.e., a dual gradient-based continuous-time distributed algorithm is proposed in which only a single dual variable is communicated with the neighbors and no private information of the node is disclosed. The proposed algorithm is simple and no specific initialization is necessary, and this in turn allows on-line change of network structure, demand, generation constraints, and even the participating nodes. The algorithm also exhibits a special behavior when the problem becomes infeasible so that each node can detect over-demand or under-demand situation of the power network.

These concerns arise from the revelation of information necessary for the provision of personalization services. We examine vendor strategies in a market where consumers have heterogeneous concerns about privacy. In successive generalizations, we allow the vendor to offer a fixed level of personalization, variable levels of personalization, and monetary transfers (coupons) to the consumers that depend on the level of personalization chosen. We show that a vendor offering a fixed level of personalization does not offer a coupon unless his marginal value of information (MVI) is sufficiently high, and even when personalization is costless, the vendor does not cover the market. Under a fixed services offering, the vendor serves the same market with or without couponing. Next, we demonstrate that in the absence of couponing, the vendor''s optimal variable personalization services contract maximizes surplus for all heterogeneous consumers, which is in contrast to standard results from monopolistic screening. When the vendor can offer coupons that vary according to personalization levels, the optimal contract is not fully revealing unless his MVI is high and he will not offer coupons when this MVI is low. However, a vendor with a moderate MVI (between certain thresholds) offers a bunched contract, wherein consumers with low privacy concerns receive a variable services-coupon contract, those with moderate privacy concerns receive a fixed services-coupon contract, and those with high privacy concerns do not participate in the market. The coupon value is decreasing in privacy sensitivity of consumers.');

There is a rich and growing literature on the economics of information. It would seem that the same economic factors that determine search behavior by workers and consumers might also determine investments in obtaining and in shielding, private information. This insight provides the starting point for the economic analysis of privacy. It is costly to assimilate heavy doses of information, much of it concerning facts of only peripheral relevance in deciding whether to hire or otherwise transact with an individual. To the author, this argument seems to be decisive against any rule requiring full disclosure of adverse personal information on the model of the securities laws or the Truth-in-Lending Act. But it does not argue for granting legal protection to private facts about a person. And it is unlikely that the failure to create such rights just leads people to expend real resources on maintaining the secrecy of facts about themselves.'),

This indeterminacy stems in large measure from the tendency of judges to think of privacy in non-instrumentalist terms. This "moral" approach to privacy is normatively questionable, and it does a poor job of identifying the circumstances in which privacy should prevail over countervailing interests, such as the deterrence of crime. In this Article, I develop an alternative, economically-informed approach to the reasonable expectation of privacy test. In contrast to the moral approach, which treats privacy as a fundamental right, the economic approach views it as an (normatively neutral) aspect of self-interest: the desire to conceal and control potentially damaging personal information. According to this view, privacy should not be protected when its primary effect is to impede the optimal deterrence of crime. In other cases, however, legal protections against governmental surveillance may enhance social welfare by encouraging productive transactions, diminishing the costs of non-legal privacy barriers, and limiting suboptimal policing practices such as discriminatory profiling and the enforcement of inefficient criminal prohibitions. Economics and public choice theory can also help to minimize decision-making error by predicting which legal actors--police, legislatures, or courts--are best placed to make optimal trade-offs between privacy and crime control.'),

Online platforms attract advertisers by offering capabilities to reach audiences likely to be receptive to their ads in a timely and accurate manner. However, the collection and processing of user information required for targeting of ads may lead to privacy concerns. We model the competition between two platforms as a two-stage game where platforms announce their targeting capabilities in the first stage and advertising fees in the second stage. The presence of heterogeneity in the user and the advertiser populations with respect to their preferences for targeting leads to differentiation between platforms. While one platform offers the minimum level of targeting feasible, the other platform offers a strictly higher level of targeting. The extent of differentiation in targeting levels depends on the intensity of competition between the platforms on the user side. When competition on the user side is relatively low, the extent of differentiation is higher. Such competition for users may decline, when users are less concerned about loss of privacy or when they choose to double home. Higher targeting differentiation allows platforms to charge higher advertising fees and earn higher profits. We also consider the case where platforms can reduce the privacy concerns of users by offering them greater control over their personal information. We demonstrate that awarding user control leads to reduced targeting differentiation between platforms and lower advertising fees. Last, we derive the equilibrium targeting levels for platforms that use a subscription-based business model instead of an advertising-based business model. '),

There are also risks if information is not shared. A review of previous surveys found that most surveys asked questions about patient''s privacy concerns and willingness to share their medical information. We found only one study that asked about sharing medical information for better care and no survey that asked patients about the risk, cost or comparison between medical privacy and privacy in other areas. To fill this gap, we designed a survey to: (1) compare medical privacy preferences to privacy preferences in other areas; (2) measure willingness to pay the cost of additional privacymeasures; and (3) measure willingness to accept the risks of not sharing information.Methods: A total of 834 patients attending physician offices at 14 sites completed all or part of an anonymous questionnaire.Results: Over 95% of patients were willing to share all their medical information with their treating physicians. There was no difference in willingness to share between primary care and specialty sites including psychiatry and an HIV clinic. In our survey, there was no difference in sharing preference between standard medical information and information with additional legal protections including genetic testing, drug/alcohol treatment and HIV results. Medical privacy was ranked lower than sharing social security and credit card numbers, but was deemed more private than other information including tax returns and handgun purchases. There was no statistical difference for any questions by site except for HIV/AIDS clinic patients ranking privacy of the medical record more important than reducing high medical costs and risk of medical errors (p < .05). Most patients were willing to spend a modest amount of additional time for privacy, but few were willing to pay more for additional medical privacy. Most patients were unwilling to take on additional risks to keep medical information hidden.Conclusions: Patients were very willing to share medical information with their providers. They were able to see the importance of sharing medical information to provide the best possible care. They were unwilling to hide information from providers if there was increased medical risk. Patients were willing to spend additional time for privacy, but most were unwilling to spend extra money. Sixty-eight percent of patients favored reducing medical costs over privacy.'),

This conception of privacy misses an important component of the policy problem. An individual who is careless with data exposes not only extensive information about herself, but about others as well. The negative externalities imposed on nonconsenting outsiders by such carelessness can be productively studied in terms of welfare economics. If all relevant individuals maximize private benefit, and expect all other relevant individuals to do the same, neoclassical economic theory predicts that society will achieve a suboptimal level of privacy. This prediction holds even if all individuals cherish privacy with the same intensity. As the theoretical literature would have it, the struggle for privacy is destined to become a tragedy. But according to the experimental public-goods literature, there is hope. Like in real life, people in experiments cooperate in groups at rates well above those predicted by neoclassical theory. Groups can be aided in their struggle to produce public goods by institutions, such as communication, framing, or sanction. With these institutions, communities can manage public goods without heavy-handed government intervention. Legal scholarship has not fully engaged this problem in these terms. In this Article, we explain why privacy has aspects of a public good, and we draw lessons from both the theoretical and the empirical literature on public goods to inform the policy discourse on privacy.'),

While these benefits are relatively measurable, the value of privacy involved in disclosing the information is much less tangible, making it hard to design and evaluate information systems that manage personal information. Meanwhile, existing methods to assess and measure the value of privacy, such as self-reported questionnaires, are notoriously unrelated of real–world behavior. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a methodology called VOPE (Value of Privacy Estimator), which relies on behavioral economics'' Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) and valuates people''s privacy preferences in information disclosure scenarios. VOPE is based on an iterative and responsive methodology in which users take or leave a transaction that includes a component of information disclosure. To evaluate the method, we conduct an empirical experiment (n = 195), estimating people''s privacy valuations in electronic commerce transactions.

The European Union implemented this idea with the Cookies Directive. The Directive aims to change the default system for tracking and move to an opt-in system in which data subjects must agree to it beforehand. This article evaluates the Directive''s implementation across Member States and studies the cases of the Netherlands and the UK. It then draws from the behavioural economics literature on default rules to evaluate these regulations and to consider whether it is possible to implement the policy in a way that avoids some of the problems they faced.'),

This paper investigates a monopolistic platform''s optimal protection level and pricing strategy under an agency business model (content agency model or advertising agency model). We find that the platform''s protection strategy hinges on the relative magnitude of the two opposing effects of protection. When the negative effect dominates, the minimal protection is optimal. However, as the positive effect becomes more salient, the platform has an incentive to increase the protection level. We also find that although the demand of non-pure platform users always increases as the level of content substitutability rises under the minimal and maximal protection regions, it is not necessarily the case under the medium protection region. The study advances our understanding of the content protection against piracy from a platform''s perspective. Our findings also provide insights into business model decision when platform protection is endogenously determined.'),

These statistics are heavily reliant on sample surveys. Recently, however, response rates for both household and business surveys have declined, increasing costs and threatening quality. Existing statistical measures, many developed decades ago, may also miss important aspects of our rapidly evolving economy; moreover, they may not be sufficiently accurate, timely, or granular to meet the increasingly complex needs of data users. Meanwhile, the rapid proliferation of online data and more powerful computation make privacy and confidentiality protections more challenging. There is broad agreement on the need to transform government statistical agencies from the 20th century survey-centric model to a 21st century model that blends structured survey data with administrative and unstructured alternative digital data sources. In this essay, I describe some work underway that hints at what 21st century official economic measurement will look like and offer some preliminary comments on what is needed to get there.'),

Surveys show that privacy is a primary concern for citizens in the digital age. On the other hand, individuals reveal personal information for relatively small rewards, often just for drawing the attention of peers in an online social network. This inconsistency of privacy attitudes and privacy behaviour is often referred to as the “privacy paradox”. In this paper, we present the results of a review of research literature on the privacy paradox. We analyse studies that provide evidence of a paradoxical dichotomy between attitudes and behaviour and studies that challenge the existence of such a phenomenon. The diverse research results are explained by the diversity in research methods, the different contexts and the different conceptualisations of the privacy paradox. We also present several interpretations of the privacy paradox, stemming from social theory, psychology, behavioural economics and, in one case, from quantum theory. We conclude that current research has improved our understanding of the privacy paradox phenomenon. It is, however, a complex phenomenon that requires extensive further research. Thus, we call for synthetic studies to be based on comprehensive theoretical models that take into account the diversity of personal information and the diversity of privacy concerns. We suggest that future studies should use evidence of actual behaviour rather than self-reported behaviour.'),

Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, has a population of two million with a growth rate of six percent. Construction of apartment buildings, as one of the alternatives to fulfil the housing needs, is on the rise. However, apartments are being designed without considering the needs of the residents. This research focuses on assessment of socio-economic profile and satisfaction of residents of single unit houses vis-à-vis of those living in apartments. Fried and Gleicher''s approach was used in this research. This study analysed the socioeconomic characteristics, level of satisfaction of residents; drivers and barriers that influence the residential satisfaction of residents in two types of residential units in Islamabad. This study finds that residents of both housing types were equally satisfied with housing attributes and surrounding neighborhood while the residents of single unit houses were more satisfied with facilities, maintenance and culture.

We model peer disclosure as the imposition of a negative externality on other people. Our model encompasses the benefits of posting information, positive externalities in the form of recognition and entertainment benefits due to others'' sharing of information, and heterogeneous privacy preferences. We find that regulation of peer disclosure is necessary. We consider two candidate regulations, i.e., nudging and quotas. Nudging reduces user participation and privacy harm and sometimes improves social welfare. By contrast, imposing a quota often improves user participation, privacy protection, and social welfare. Adding a nudge on top of a quota does not bring additional benefits. We show that any regulation that uniformly controls the disclosure of sensitive and nonsensitive information will not serve the triple objectives of reducing privacy harm, increasing social welfare, and increasing information contribution. We derive a necessary condition for solutions that can fulfill these three objectives. We also compare the incentives of the platform owner and social planner and draw related managerial and policy implications.'),

While this new paradigm may shift the balance of power between individuals and companies that harvest and mine data, it raises some practical, fundamental questions for users of these services: how they should decide which data must be vended and which data protected, and what a good deal is. In this work, we investigate a mechanism that aims at helping users address these questions. The investigated mechanism relies on a hard-privacy model and allows users to share partial or complete profile data with broker and data-mining companies in exchange for an economic reward. The theoretical analysis of the trade-off between privacy and money posed by such mechanism is the object of this work. We adopt a generic measure of privacy although part of our analysis focuses on some important examples of Bregman divergences. We find a parametric solution to the problem of optimal exchange of privacy for money, and obtain a closed-form expression and characterize the trade-off between profile-disclosure risk and economic reward for several interesting cases. Finally, we evaluate experimentally how our approach could contribute to privacy protection in a real-world data-brokerage scenario.'),

They cater to people of all demographics and provide services to patrons they wouldn''t be able to get anywhere else. The list of services libraries provide is extensive and comprehensive, although unfortunately, there are significant gaps in what our services can offer, particularly those regarding technology advancement and patron privacy. Though library classes on educating patrons'' privacy protection are a valiant effort, we can do so much more and lead the way, maybe not for the privacy industry but for our communities and patrons. Creating a strong foundational knowledge will help patrons leverage these new skills in their day to day lives as well as help them educate their families about common privacy issues. In this column, we''ll explore some of the ways libraries can utilize their current resources as well as provide ideas on how we can maximize their effectiveness and roll new technologies into their operations.'),

From the perspective of these platforms, this paper investigates the impact of fairness (outcome fairness and procedural fairness) on the patients'' willingness to disclose privacy in the platform, and the role of perceived platform interactivity in this effect. Survey analysis of 1,546 online medical platform users shows that outcome fairness and procedural fairness have a direct positive impact on both the patient''s perceived platform interactivity and their willingness for privacy disclosure, while the perceived interactivity is found to enhance the willingness for privacy disclosure. These findings provide theoretical and practical guidance for online medical community platforms in encouraging patients to disclose information.'),

A key challenge for realizing the vision is, however, “How will the technology system handle user data?” For the user centric and data centric 5G technologies to be accepted and function as a viable business model, user trust in their data privacy is paramount.

Analysis of consumer-related and consumer-generated data is a very important way to measure the success of on-line retailing. The software packages for data analysis have two major shortcomings: (1) solutions are not offered as a service reachable by standard procedures over the Internet, but as isolated standalone applications or ERP system modules; (2) privacy restrictions need to be integrated into a framework of business analytics for Web retailers. The first aspect can be addressed with standardized developer software for Web services, but the second must consider privacy legislation, privacy specifications on Web sites (P3P), and data reidentification problems. These shortcomings are addressed by a proposed formal model of these problems and an implementation of the model as a declarative specification of privacy constraints, expressed as an extension of P3P. The constraints are complemented by a logic identifying the elements in a given set of Web analytics that might lead to data reidentification and therefore violate implicit privacy constraints. A Web-based service is presented that uses these components to automatically adapt the set of available Web analytics to an on-line retailer''s P3P policy. The system was tested on a large data set from a major European multichannel retailer.'),

Although users must grant permission before their personal information is shared, they often do so without knowing the consequences of their decision. Based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates service providers to comprehensively inform users about the purpose and terms of personal data processing, this article examines how increased transparency regarding personal data processing practices in mobile permission requests impact users in making informed decisions. We conducted an online experiment with 307 participants to test the effect of transparency on users’ decisions about and comprehension of the requested permission. The results indicate increased comprehension of data processing practices when privacy policies are transparently disclosed, whereas acceptance rates do not vary significantly. We condense our findings into principles that service providers can apply to design privacy-transparent mobile apps.'),

Due to the increasing reliance of networking applications on sharing ICT services, dependencies threaten privacy, security, and reliability of information and, thus, innovative business applications in smart societies. Resilience is becoming a new security approach, since it takes dependencies into account and aims at achieving equilibriums in case of opposite requirements. This special issue on ''Security and Privacy in Business Networking'' contributes to the journal ''Electronic Markets'' by introducing a different view on achieving acceptable secure business networking applications in spite of threats due to covert channels. This view is on adapting resilience to enforcement of IT security in business networking applications. Our analysis shows that privacy is an evidence to measure and improve trustworthy relationships and reliable interactions between participants of business processes and their IT systems. The articles of this special issue, which have been accepted after a double-blind peer review, contribute to this view on interdisciplinary security engineering in regard to the stages of security and privacy requirements analysis, enforcement of resulting security requirements for an information exchange, testing with a privacy-preserving detection of policy violations, and knowledge management for the purpose of keeping business processes resilient.'),

A major obstacle is the perception that the owner can unfairly exploit trading information for competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a marketplace design that shifts the locus of control over trader privacy from the marketplace operator to each individual trader. We show how online transactions between trading partners can be conducted in total privacy, so that not even the marketplace owner/operator can exploit transaction information for strategic purposes. At the same time, our approach includes robust methods for transaction integrity and nonrepudiation, as well as posttransaction dispute resolution.'),

They select databases, use instructional software, and promote intellectual freedom including student access to the Internet. Propelled by the significant benefits of learning, engagement, and personalized instruction, many of their schools and districts have rapidly adopted online services without establishing standardized controls or protections for the massive amounts of student data being collected and shared. A 2013 study by Fordham Law School''s Center on Law and Information Policy found that, while cloud services were deployed for wide-ranging functions in 95 percent of the six demographically and geographically diverse districts surveyed, they were "poorly under-stood, non-transparent, and weakly governed." The study noted "rampant gaps" in vendor-school contract documentation, an absence of policies governing privacy, and a failure to inform parents about their children''s exposure to online services (Reidenberg et al. 2013, g).

The situation is changing quickly. Some large districts now employ teams of in-house legal and policy experts who are charged with protecting student data and specifying measurable characteristics of "safe" online products. Most schools are in the process of developing privacy protocols and priorities. A strategic opportunity exists for school librarians to become leaders in shaping school privacy practices by guiding students, families, and faculty in wise and safe technology use while advocating for privacy rights. As advocates for thoughtful online learning, we must, at the very least, examine data confidentiality policies for the products we select and disseminate. More strategically, in our role as digital citizenship educators we must participate in our institutional decision-making process. We hold in our hands a fundamental responsibility to students as learners and citizens in a democracy guided by our profession''s core values, which state that "Protecting user privacy and confidentiality is necessary for intellectual freedom and fundamental to the ethics and practice of librarianship" (ALA2004).'),

In electronic marketplaces, the reputation of an business entity (retailer, seller) is computed by aggregating the “trust-scores” assigned to her by the parties who have had transactions with her. Most reputation systems designed for online marketplaces use all the available trust-scores to compute the reputation of business entity. However, in some scenarios, the consumer may wish to compute the reputation of a business entity by considering the trust-scores from a set of trustworthy participants, however, she does not want to disclose the identities of the users she trusts. There are two privacy protection challenges in the design of this kind of personalized reputation system: 1) protecting the set of trusted users of participants, and 2) protecting the trust-scores assigned by the participants in the trusted set. In this paper, we present a novel framework for computing the personalized global reputation of a business entity by considering the trust-scores from a set of trusted participants without disclosing identities of participants in the trusted set and their trust-scores. To this extent, the participants share cryptograms of their trust-scores for the business entity to the decentralized public bulletin board or tally center. These encrypted trust-scores are then used by the requester to compute the personalized reputation score of the business entity without leaking private information of participants in the system. We have analyzed the security and privacy properties of the scheme for the malicious adversarial model. The protocol has a linear message complexity, which proves that the system can be deployed in a real setup where such personalized recommendations may be required in practice. Furthermore, the system ensures correctness, privacy and security of trust-scores of participants in the trusted set under the malicious adversarial model.'),

Many online business exchanges require the disclosure of sensitive personal information on a regular basis. Simultaneously, customers are reluctant to disclose private information online due to concerns about privacy. Thus, trust plays a critical role in such disclosures. However, a number of factors could influence the extent of customers’ trust and their willingness to disclose their private information. In this study, we explore the critical roles of two sets of factors: the sensitivity of the context within which the private information is disclosed and the customer''s personality. Our theory building is based on the contextualization of the theory of reasoned action (TRA-Privacy) and its synthesis with Prospect theory. Our theory argues that context sensitivity as a moderator and individuals’ salient attributes in terms of personality types and privacy concern are critical factors impacting trust and the willingness to disclose personal information. Our results indicate that context moderates the parameters and path structure of the trust model and that the influence of personality on privacy concern and trust depends on the nature of the context. Applying these “who” and “where” aspects of theory building, the study opens a new avenue of context-related research that can further increase the specificity and richness of trust and privacy research. The study also provides a new perspective in trust scholarship, therein requiring the examination of three inter-related components: trustee, trustor and the context of trust.'),

However, the potential for technology to facilitate long term retention of customers'' personal information raises concerns about the competing right of individuals to the privacy of their personal information. Although the European Commission has recently released a proposal for regulation to “provide a data subject with the right to be forgotten and to erasure”, neither the OECD Privacy Guidelines nor the APEC Privacy Framework includes any requirement to delete personal information. While New Zealand includes a “limited retention principle” in the Privacy Act 1993, apart from one limited exception the privacy principles cannot be enforced in court. Taking New Zealand privacy law as an example, this paper examines the issue of retention of customer data, explains why this is a serious problem and argues that although it could be addressed by appropriate amendments to domestic laws, domestic privacy legislation may not be sufficient in an online environment. In the same way as other areas of law, such as the intellectual property regime, have turned to global regulatory standards which reflect the international nature of their subject matter, international privacy regulation should be the next stage for the information privacy regime.'),

Such a social contract understanding of privacy could produce more practical guidance for organizations and managers who have employees, users, and future customers all with possibly different conceptions of privacy across contexts. However, this theoretical suggestion, while intuitively appealing, has not been empirically examined. This study validates a social contract approach to privacy by examining whether and how privacy norms vary across communities and contractors. The findings from this theoretical examination support the use of contractual business ethics to understand privacy in research and in practice. As predicted, insiders to a community had significantly different understandings of privacy norms as compared to outsiders. In addition, all respondents held different privacy norms across hypothetical contexts, thereby suggesting privacy norms are contextually understood within a particular community of individuals. The findings support two conclusions. First, individuals hold different privacy norms without necessarily having diminished expectations of privacy. Individuals differed on the factors they considered important in calculating privacy expectations, yet all groups had robust privacy expectations across contexts. Second, outsiders have difficulty in understanding the privacy norms of a particular community. For managers and scholars, this renders privacy expectations more difficult to identify at a distance or in deductive research. The findings speak directly to the needs of organizations to manage a diverse set of privacy issues across stakeholder groups.'),

Next, we leverage the Kano model and data from two internet-based surveys to analyze the measures’ evaluation by customers. From a customer perspective, the implementation of the majority of measures is obligatory as those measures are considered as basic needs of must-be quality. However, delighting measures of attractive quality do exist and have the potential to create a competitive advantage.

The sharing of data has been proven beneficial in data mining applications. However, privacy regulations and other privacy concerns may prevent data owners from sharing information for data analysis. To resolve this challenging problem, data owners must design a solution that meets privacy requirements and guarantees valid data clustering results. To achieve this dual goal, we introduce a new method for privacy-preserving clustering called Dimensionality Reduction-Based Transformation (DRBT). This method relies on the intuition behind random projection to protect the underlying attribute values subjected to cluster analysis. The major features of this method are: (a) it is independent of distance-based clustering algorithms; (b) it has a sound mathematical foundation; and (c) it does not require CPU-intensive operations. We show analytically and empirically that transforming a data set using DRBT, a data owner can achieve privacy preservation and get accurate clustering with a little overhead of communication cost.'),

This paper empirically studies the location decisions of internet firms when they face high legal standards of privacy protection. Many factors might influence them: technological spillovers, lower taxation, and so on. Internet firms can also arbitrate national differences and many of them actually locate their activity in order to escape from national laws they consider over-stringent. In the current stage of development of the internet—the so-called Web 2.0—the ease of access to personal data proved to be strategic input. So the more a jurisdiction makes collecting and using these data easy, the more attractive the country is, if all other things remain constant. One way for a firm to avoid such legal restrictions is to locate or to expand its business in less privacy protective countries. Our empirical results support this ‘no-privacy haven’ hypothesis. In particular, we highlight a new privacy paradox according to which the more stringent certain online privacy laws are, the more they induce firms to locate their business in less stringent countries, and finally the weaker actual privacy protection on the internet is.'),

The European Union (EU) has firmly set its stall out to protect individuals'' data and privacy and has demonstrated this through the rejection of the old opt-out regime and the introduction of the new opt-in rules. These require businesses to obtain individual''s prior and informed consent before their data are collected, stored and used for the purposes of online behavioural advertising (OBA). Individuals in the EU are afforded protection from the apparent dangers relating to data privacy and misuse that is associated with OBA, which is beyond the expectation of most Internet users. However, there are some criticisms levelled at the law that the EU has produced. Is simply gaining informed consent sufficient for protecting all types of information? Do certain types of information require a higher level of consent than others? Does the law fulfil its aim of protecting data subject''s privacy and data? Is the current law restrictive to business? Do individuals know or care that their information is being collected for the purposes of targeted advertising and is there a better way to ensure that they do? Finally, will proposed new law to be found in the EU Data Protection Regulation solve any of these problems? This article will assess whether, as a policy decision, the EU''s current approach has been too cautious in its attempts to protect individuals or restrict business.

Digital mental health services are increasingly endorsed by governments and health professionals as a low cost, accessible alternative or adjunct to face-to-face therapy. App users may suffer loss of personal privacy due to security breaches or common data sharing practices between app developers and third parties. Loss of privacy around personal health data may harm an individual''s reputation or health. The purpose of this project was to identify salient consumer issues related to privacy in the mental health app market and to inform advocacy efforts towards promoting consumer interests. We conducted a critical content analysis of promotional (advertising) materials for prominent mental health apps in selected dominant English-speaking markets in late 2016-early 2017, updated in 2018. We identified 61 prominent mental health apps, 56 of which were still available in 2018. Apps frequently requested permission to access elements of the user''s mobile device, including requesting so-called ‘dangerous’ permissions. Many apps encouraged users to share their own data with an online community. Nearly half of the apps (25/61, 41%) did not have a privacy policy to inform users about how and when personal information would be collected and retained or shared with third parties, despite this being a standard recommendation of privacy regulations. We consider that the app industry pays insufficient attention to protecting the privacy of mental health app users. We advocate for increased monitoring and enforcement of privacy principles and practices in mental health apps and the mobile ecosystem, more broadly. We also suggest a re-framing of regulatory attention that places consumer interests at the centre of guidance.

Coworkers are asked to use new information technology, users of gmail are asked to use GoogleBuzz, patients and doctors are asked to record health records online, etc. Understanding how privacy expectations change, if at all, and the mechanisms by which such a variance is produced will help organizations make such transitions. This paper examines whether and how privacy expectations change based on the technological platform of an information exchange. The results suggest that privacy expectations are significantly distinct when the information exchange is located on a novel technology as compared to a more established technology. Furthermore, this difference is best explained when modeled by a shift in privacy expectations rather than fully technology-specific privacy norms. These results suggest that privacy expectations online are connected to privacy offline with a different base privacy expectation. Surprisingly, out of the five locations tested, respondents consistently assign information on email the greatest privacy protection. In addition, while undergraduate students differ from non-undergraduates when assessing a social networking site, no difference is found when judging an exchange on email. In sum, the findings suggest that novel technology may introduce temporary conceptual muddles rather than permanent privacy vacuums. The results reported here challenge conventional views about how privacy expectations differ online versus offline. Traditionally, management scholarship examines privacy online or with a specific new technology platform in isolation and without reference to the same information exchange offline. However, in the present study, individuals appear to have a shift in their privacy expectations but retain similar factors and their relative importance—the privacy equation by which they form judgments—across technologies. These findings suggest that privacy scholarship should make use of existing privacy norms within contexts when analyzing and studying privacy in a new technological platform.'),

This new form of computing environment is known as the “Internet-of-Things” (IoT). The adoption of IoT is fast and the “things” are becoming integral part of people day-to-day life as well as essential elements in the businesses everyday activities and processes. Open characteristics of IoT environments raises privacy concern as “things” are autonomous with some degree of authority to sharing their capabilities and knowledge to fulfil their individual or collective tasks. As such privacy becomes central and an inherit computational aspect of the “things”. The work presented here is based on modelling IoT as Cooperative Distributed Systems (CDS). It proposes a novel approach of analysing and modelling privacy concepts and concerns. Privacy protection is captured as a form of “sensitive information” management at the interaction level. A privacy protection management framework for CDS at the interaction level is proposed. The application of the framework has been demonstrated by extending Contract Net Protocol (CNP) to support privacy protection for CDS.

Public opinion surveys show that many citizens are becoming greatly concerned about threats to their information privacy, with levels of such concern reaching all-time highs. Perhaps as a response to the growing concerns of citizens, the media are devoting more attention to privacy issues, and governmental regulation of the corporate privacy environment is increasing in many countries. Almost all developed countries have grappled with the trade-offs between open access to information-which enables economic efficiency-and an individual''s right to privacy. Consistent with these trade-offs, many recent incidents suggest that regulatory approaches to information privacy, corporate management of personal data, and consumer reactions are becoming tightly interwoven around the world. To provide some insights into these relationships, we develop a conceptual model and test it with a cross-cultural sample from 19 different countries. In general, we find that a country''s regulatory approach to the corporate management of information privacy is affected by its cultural values and by individuals'' information privacy concerns. In addition, as governments become more involved in the corporate management of information privacy, internal management of such issues seems to tighten. This result supports previous observations that most firms take a primarily reactive approach to managing privacy by waiting for an external threat before crafting cohesive policies that confront their information practices. Moreover, when corporations are not perceived to adequately manage information privacy issues, and/or when privacy concerns rise, individuals are more inclined to prefer government intervention and be distrustful of firm self-regulation. As such, citizens may look to lawmakers to enact stricter regulation to reduce their privacy concerns. These findings and several international trends suggest that the self-regulatory model of privacy governance may not be sustainable over the long term. Findings from this research constitute an important contribution to the emerging theoretical base of information privacy research and should be particularly enlightening to those managing information privacy issues. Several directions for future research are also discussed.'),

This paper proposes and tests a Privacy Boundary Management Model, explaining how consumers formulate and manage their privacy boundary. It also analyzes the effect of the five dimensions of privacy policy (Fair Information Practices) on privacy boundary formation to assess how customers link these dimensions to the effectiveness of privacy policy. Survey data was collected from 363 customers who have used online banking websites for a minimum of six months. Partial Least Square results showed that the validated research model accounts for high variance in perceived privacy. Four elements of the Fair Information Practice Principles (access, notice, security, and enforcement) have significant impact on perceived effectiveness of privacy policy. Perceived effectiveness in turn significantly influences perceived privacy control and perceived privacy risk. Perceived privacy control significantly influences trust and perceived privacy. Perceived privacy concern and trust also significantly influence perceived privacy.'),

To address this, some community pharmacies are rearranging their retail space to provide private areas for clinical consultations. Such facilities are deemed particularly important when dealing with clients who have sensitive medical conditions, such as opioid dependence.
 
Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with OST clients. Recruitment and the interviews were conducted at state government drug and alcohol clinic. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were analysed in NVivo using the framework approach.
 
Results We interviewed fourteen OST clients. Most participants were concerned about privacy and considered that the pharmacy layout could enhance or hinder privacy. However, they disagreed about exactly which pharmacy layout was most privacy-protecting. In addition, a small group of clients interviewed who had a very positive relationship with pharmacists believed that the relationship contributed to their confidence that their privacy was protected.
 
Conclusions There is little consensus amongst consumers about how to protect privacy in the community pharmacy. The range of views expressed by clients in this study may reflect the lack of consensus about the nature of privacy in health ethics. Attention to the meaning of and rationales for privacy protections may be helpful when designing pharmacy layouts to meet the needs of a broad range of consumers. An enclosed or screened private area which can be used as a consultation area for all private pharmacy discussions, including for OST dosing, could be a solution to addressing these varying views on privacy in the pharmacy. Further attention to enhancing the pharmacist and client relationship may assist in reducing sensitivity about privacy.'),

This paper comprehensively analyses and consolidates the relevant literature on the emerging concept of IoT and servitized business models through conducting a systematic literature review. Based on an analysis of 74 articles, four archetypes of business models are identified that are enabled by the IoT: add-on, sharing, usage-based and solution-oriented and supplemented with information on what role IoT adoption takes, benefits from the provider perspective, and the inhibiting factors per archetype. A framework draws the findings together and forms five propositions about these elements and their corresponding business models that may guide future empirical research and serve as a common typology. Therefore, this study contributes to the body of knowledge on innovative servitized business models by classifying emergent business models utilising IoT and what is currently known about them. For practice, this paper provides an overview for initial consideration by practitioners before adopting IoT in enabling servitized business models and the range of applications IoT may have in enabling servitized business models with examples.'),

Mobile application firms can collect granular and largely unregulated data about their consumers, and must make ethical decisions about how and whether to collect, store, and share these data. This paper conducts a discourse analysis of mobile application developer forums to discover when and how privacy conversations, as a representative of larger ethical debates, arise during development. It finds that online forums can be useful spaces for ethical deliberations, as developers use these spaces to define, discuss, and justify their values. It also discovers that ethical discussions in mobile development are prompted by work practices which vary considerably between iOS and Android, today''s two major mobile platforms. For educators, regulators, and managers interested in encouraging more ethical discussion and deliberation in mobile development, these work practices provide a valuable point of entry. But while the triggers for privacy conversations are quite different between platforms, ultimately the justifications for privacy are similar. Developers for both platforms use moral and cautionary tales, moral evaluation, and instrumental and technical rationalization to justify and legitimize privacy as a value in mobile development. Understanding these three forms of justification for privacy is useful to educators, regulators, and managers who wish to promote ethical practices in mobile development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

The boundaries of public and private information are ambiguous because users are not always aware of or have agreed to the fact that their content is to be used openly. The case was complicated by the fact that the use of these data by researchers violated an unconsciously infringed upon right of a vulnerable community with a weak legal position. This paper describes the debate on this topic among researchers from engineering and humanities fields on whether the purpose of the research was ethically acceptable; how the systems can be embedded in ethical values; and what ethical, legal, social, and educational lessons are appropriate for governance of artificial intelligence (AI). Our analysis aimed not only to clarify the abstract concept of privacy but also to make changes to the submission guidelines for authors. We hope that our analysis contributes to the governance of ethical AIs and AI ethics on handling sensitive aspects of online activities.'),

While the ethical and legal discussion about these issues is ongoing, so is research practice. The aim of this qualitative case study is to gain more insight into how these concerns are currently dealt with in practice. For this multiple-case study, the YOUth cohort, a longitudinal cohort focusing on psychosocial development, and Big Data Psychiatry, a pilot study in Big Data analytics on psychiatric health data, were selected. A broad range of relevant documents were collected and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders were conducted. Data were coded, studied and divided into themes during an iterative analytical process. Three themes emerged: abandoning anonymisation, reconfiguring participant control, and the search for guidance and expertise. Overall, the findings show that it takes considerable effort to take privacy and data protection norms into account in a Big Data health research initiative, especially when individual participant level data need to be linked or enriched. By embracing the complexity of the law in an early phase, setbacks could be prevented, the existing flexibility within the law could be utilised, and systems or organisations could be designed and constructed to take relevant rules into account. Our paper illustrates that a close collaboration of experts with different backgrounds within the initiative may be necessary to be able to successfully navigate this process.'),

While recent legal authority in numerous jurisdictions affords competent minors the right to consent to medical treatment, the guidelines for assessing competence are often vague or non-existent. In addition, these changes have not adequately addressed the issue of confidentiality, and it is unclear whether general practitioners (GPs) owe a duty of confidentiality to competent minors. As medical practitioners are the first point of contact in medical settings, the present study explored GPs'' competence and confidentiality determinations regarding a 16-year-old female patient who presented with symptoms of an eating disorder. Questionnaires and hypothetical scenarios were sent to a sample of 1000 GPs, of which 305 responded. Results indicated that 62% of respondents would have found the patient competent, while 82% would have maintained her confidentiality. However, analysis of the rationales provided for these decisions revealed a wide discrepancy in GPs'' understanding and implementation of current legal principles. This research highlights the necessity of providing GPs with clear guidelines regarding competence and confidentiality determinations when dealing with minors.'),

The increased costs associated with compliance with the rule, and the increased potential for financial liability, raises the possibility that hospitals may be less likely to participate in such research, resulting in a decrease of the validity of multisite studies designed to represent an entire population. Our multisite medical record validation study, designed to assess the accuracy of maternally linked birth records, provides an overview of a number of HIPAA implementation challenges. We found that the new HIPAA rule presents new challenges for those who rely on the release of medical record information for epidemiologic research. At the very minimum, increased compliance costs associated with human subjects protection and increased administrative burden for researchers would seem to be inevitable as medical institutions address the requirements of the new HIPAA rule by instituting more complex and thus more cumbersome procedures.

While the GDPR is meant to protect users'' privacy, the main problem is that it does not provide explicit guidelines for designers and developers about how to build systems that comply with it. In order to bridge this gap, we systematically analysed the legal text, carried out expert interviews, and ran a nine-week-long take-home study with four developers. We particularly focused on user-facing issues, as these have received little attention compared to technical issues. Our main contributions are a list of aspects from the legal text of the GDPR that can be tackled at the user interface level and a set of guidelines on how to realise this.

Many factors might influence them: technological spillovers, lower taxation, and so on. Internet firms can also arbitrate national differences and many of them actually locate their activity in order to escape from national laws they consider over-stringent. In the current stage of development of the internet—the so-called Web 2.0—the ease of access to personal data proved to be strategic input. So the more a jurisdiction makes collecting and using these data easy, the more attractive the country is, if all other things remain constant. One way for a firm to avoid such legal restrictions is to locate or to expand its business in less privacy protective countries. Our empirical results support this ‘no-privacy haven’ hypothesis. In particular, we highlight a new privacy paradox according to which the more stringent certain online privacy laws are, the more they induce firms to locate their business in less stringent countries, and finally the weaker actual privacy protection on the internet is.'),

Projects like the Rockefeller Foundation-funded "100 Resilient Cities" are exploring how big data can be used to design and strengthen resilience in cities around the world. Large technology companies are helping to design and secure components of the Internet of Everything, which is part of a smart city structure. Relationships between governments and citizens, as well as between individuals and businesses, will see substantial changes due to this rapidly expanding collection and use of potentially intimate information. In this dynamic environment, it is difficult to protect privacy under traditional principles that did not anticipate a sensor-connected, surveillance-laden, data-driven world of the smart city. Slow moving court cases and inflexible fair information privacy practices may be insufficient to limit and/or guide smart city implementation that respects individual privacy. Cities need a methodology that will enable a discussion of how law, regulation, and social norms can respond to the dynamic disruption that a smart city poses to the fundamental nature of privacy. This Article proposes that resilience theory can be a useful lens for this analysis. Resilience theory has multidiscipUnary roots in engineering, biology, ecology, and sociology, and is generally understood as a way to understand how systems react to extreme pressures--whether they decline and die, or whether they adapt and thrive. The theory is used to describe multiple aspects of systems and organisms, from the ability of a building to withstand an earthquake to the ability of an organism not only to survive, but to also evolve into a different and possible better state. This Article views privacy as a system and examines it through the resiliency lens, framing the question of how privacy can adapt and survive in a smart city'),

The article then explores the extent to which these fields are becoming more integrated; and also the risks of relying on technology (notably through Privacy by Design) to do this, particularly given the uncertainties embraced by lawyers and which can be problematic to technologists. Having identified challenges in meeting both energy efficiency and privacy/data protection goals at the same time, the article develops two responses. One looks more widely in law, to competition, to prevent particular activity and to confirm the relevance of greater legal interdisciplinarity. The other is a more multi-faceted collaborative governance approach, involving legal and technical expertise and consumer perspectives, with standards having a valuable role. Addressing climate change through greater energy efficiency should be an appropriate motivation to bring about this second approach, which draws on wider environmental governance developments. With largely a UK and EU focus, but seeking to be of transnational relevance, the paper makes key contributions as to the capacity and limits of how law can address societal challenges; explores the risks of assuming that social and legal problems can be readily addressed by technology; confirms the need for lawyers to look to other fields of law; and assists progress in an increasingly intersectional and dynamic field.'),

We present a model that both captures the essence of privacy loss and can be easily applied to policy evaluations and doctrinal debates. To do so, we use standard Bayesian statistics to formalize a key intuition: that information privacy is fundamentally linked to how much other people know about you. A key advantage of our model is that, for the first time, it takes privacy preferences seriously while maintaining tractability. Another key advantage is that, by viewing privacy as a continuum, it is more realistic and is better suited for evaluating "gray areas" than prior models.

We apply this framework to two central areas of privacy law: the common law privacy tort and the Fourth Amendment''s third party doctrine. In the tort context, we first show how our proposal helps to clarify current law, and then use it to distinguish between the two interests protected by the privacy tort: privacy interests and reputational interests. We then propose a simple framework for judges to use in providing remedies for both classes of claims. We then move on to the third party doctrine. We show that many of the shortcomings associated with the doctrine stem from the misguided assumption that privacy is dichotomous rather than a spectrum, as in our model. We then liken this to the standard of care familiar from tort law, and show how the current doctrine results in the equivalent of a strict liability standard, rather than a more appropriate negligence-based standard.'),

Prior research has investigated the impact of Big Data on individual privacy rights, however, there is also growing recognition of its capacity to be mobilized for surveillance purposes. Our paper delineates the underlying issues of privacy and surveillance and presents them as in tension with one another. We postulate that efforts at controlling Big Data may create a trade-off of risks rather than an overall improvement in data protection. We explore this idea in relation to the principles of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as it arguably embodies the new ‘gold standard’ of cyber-laws. We posit that safeguards advocated by the law, anonymization and pseudonymization, while representing effective counter measures to privacy concerns, also incentivize the use, collection, and trade of behavioral and other forms of de-identified data. We consider the legal status of these ownerless forms of data, arguing that data protection techniques such as anonymization and pseudonymization raise significant concerns over the ownership of behavioral data and its potential use in the large-scale modification of activities and choices made both on and offline'),

Privacy protection of surveillance videos aims to protect privacy information without hampering normal processing tasks of the cloud. Privacy Region Protection only protects the privacy region while keeping the non-privacy region visually intact to facilitate processing in the cloud. However, full reversibility, i.e. the complete recovery of the original video which is critical to digital investigation and law enforcement has not been properly addressed in privacy region protection. In this paper, we introduce fully reversible privacy region protection into cloud video surveillance and propose a novel fully reversible privacy protection method for H.264/AVC compressed video. All the operations are performed in the compressed domain and avoid lossy re-encoding, so the original H.264/AVC compressed video can be fully recovered. To our best knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first fully reversible one for privacy region protection. Experimental results and performance comparison demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.'),

This article sets out to problematize the notion of trade-off through a conceptual analysis of surveillance and privacy. Given that surveillance and privacy belong to distinct conceptual systems, this analysis calls for two separate discussions. On the one hand, the analysis of surveillance needs to pay attention to the institutional legacy of surveillance practices and focus on the role of digital technologies in upgrading and extending the capacities of surveillance. The analysis of privacy, on the other hand, takes into account that people''s activities in privacy are embedded in the fabric of their everyday lives. Four set of practices seem central to privacy: dignity, retreat, anonymity and secrecy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

He claims that today, under the crushing weightlessness of virtuality, citizens are less confident, more willing to retreat into the idiocy of private life. He goes on to address the promotion of paranoia that accompanies electronic communications and privacy breaches. He points out that not only are electronic communications monitored with the intent both of selling commercial products and also detecting dissenters from whatever dominant social, economic or political agenda is operative at any particular time and in any particular place; but, according to those who know it best (Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald and the rest of the usual suspects), the extent of this surveillance has made the entire concept of privacy obsolete, something future generations will never experience and will not be able to imagine (Greenwald, 2014). Doughty goes on to introduce four hierarchical levels of electronic information media and surveillance issues that, while categorically distinct, are interconnected: (1) the "micro" level (includes educators'' work in relation to students, classrooms, chat rooms, curriculum design, teaching "strategies" and "delivery systems," and the like); (2) the "meso" level (involves educators'' institutional settings, focuses on educators'' relationship to their immediate administrative arrangements and college management structures and involves their frontline supervisors, CEOs, and Human Resources department); (3) the "macro" level (deals with educators'' institution''s organizational superiors, commonly in the form of some governmental ministry, local Board of Governors, Trustees, Regents, etc. and whatever accrediting agency is authorized to take responsibility for the bulk of their funding and academic legitimacy); and (4) the "meta" level (connects educators to broader cultural, social and economic patterns in compliance with which they describe, explain and justify their overall enterprise and which subtly or stridently imposes its norms and practices upon them). His discussion focuses on the "micro" and "meso" levels and delves into the following four issues: (1) employee rights and academic freedom; (2) student vigilantes; (3) social media interaction with students; and (4) student tracking devices.'),

The present article investigates people''s attitudes towards corporate collection of personal data, discusses possible reasons for attitude results in relation to self-regulation, trust and media context, and compares these findings with results from the previous year. The study is based on a survey using a large-n probability sample of the Swedish population. The results are in accordance with the suggested privacy paradox: the majority of the population, as in the previous year, have negative attitudes towards corporate collection of their data, largely independent of context. Nonetheless, they continue to share their data without making any great effort to secure their privacy. Whether this depends on inexperience, ignorance or resignation, everyday corporate surveillance does not meet expectations regarding the just governing of informational privacy. As the results showed that the more positive people were towards sharing their data in various contexts, the more positively this affected their attitudes towards the fact that the data were being used by the collecting companies for various purposes, balancing out the power differences online would benefit not only users but also companies to a great extent.

This right is at risk from a new and increasing threat: the collection and use of non-personally identifying information such as IP addresses through online behavioral tracking. This paper provides an overview of behavioral tracking, identifying the risks and benefits, describes the mechanisms used to track this information, and offers strategies that can be used to identify and limit behavioral tracking. We argue that this knowledge is critical for librarians in two interconnected ways. First, librarians should be evaluating recommended websites with respect to behavioral tracking practices to help protect patron privacy; second, they should be providing digital literacy education about behavioral tracking to empower patrons to protect their own privacy online.

Typically, the threat is viewed as coming from Big Brother (the government) or Company Man (the firm). But for a nascent data practice we call "self-surveillance," the threat may actually come from ourselves. Using various existing and emerging technologies, such as GPS-enabled smartphones, we are beginning to measure ourselves in granular detail--how long we sleep, where we drive, what we breathe, what we eat, how we spend our time. And we are storing these data casually, perhaps promiscuously, somewhere in the "cloud" and giving third parties broad access. This data practice of self-surveillance will decrease information privacy in troubling ways. To counter this trend, we recommend the creation of the Privacy Data Guardian, a new profession that manages Privacy Data Vaults, which are repositories for self- surveillance data. In addition to providing technical specifications of this" approach, we outline the specific legal relations, which include a fiduciary relationship, between client and Guardian. In addition, we recommend the creation of an evidentiary privilege, similar to a trade-secret privilege, that protects self-surveillance data held by a licensed Guardian. We also answer objections that our solution is implausible or useless. We conclude by pointing out that various legal, technological, and self-regulatory attempts at safeguarding privacy from new digital, interconnected technologies have not been particularly successful. Before self-surveillance becomes a widespread practice, some new innovation is needed. In our view, that innovation is a new "species," the Personal Data Guardian, created through a fusion of law and technology and released into the current information ecosystem.

These vehicle safety communication (VSC) technologies rely on the creation of autonomous, self-organizing, wireless communication networks connecting vehicles with roadside infrastructure and with each other. As the technical standards and communication protocols for VSC technologies are still being developed, certain ethical implications of these new information technologies emerge: Coupled with the predicted safety benefits of VSC applications is a potential rise in the ability to surveil a driver engaging in her everyday activities on the public roads. This paper will explore how the introduction of VSC technologies might disrupt the “contextual integrity” of personal information flows in the context of highway travel and threaten one’s “privacy in public.” Since VSC technologies and their related protocols and standards are still in the developmental stage, the paper will conclude by revealing how close attention to the ethical implications of the remaining design decisions can inform and guide designers of VSC technologies to create innovate safety applications that increase public safety, but without compromising the value of one’s privacy in public.'),

Small airplanes are rigged with high-tech cameras that can continuously transmit real-time images to the ground. The aircraft is able to monitor an area of thirty square miles for ten hours at a time. This technology allows video analysts to zoom in and track the location of vehicles, and even people. It was originally designed for military use during the Iraq War, but since then, it has been adapted for civilian applications. In 2016, the Baltimore Police Department contracted with Persistent Surveillance Systems to carry out a trial run of aerial surveillance over the city. The public was not informed that they were being watched every day. The Supreme Court has long held that aerial surveillance itself does not constitute a search for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment. The persistency of this new kind of reconnaissance changes the calculus. Specialized airplanes enable law enforcement agencies to survey sizable regions for hours on end. It is precisely this power that makes persistent aerial surveillance more like constant GPS monitoring, which the Court has already considered a search. These modes of long-term observation are intrusive and violate a reasonable expectation of privacy. Police action must be analyzed over time as a collective sequence of steps, not just an individual instance. The aggregate search can qualify under the Fourth Amendment, even if the individual steps did not. This is because prolonged surveillance reveals privacies and intimate details of life that short-term surveillance does not. Repetition, indeed habit, are cornerstones of personality and identity. People may reasonably expect some form of surveillance. People may also expect those observations to remain disconnected and nondescript. This technology presents intriguing opportunities for law enforcement departments, in the investigation of crime, the presentation of evidence at trial, deterrence and crime reduction, exonerating the wrongfully convicted, and even traffic management and highway control. These advantages are not enough--and will never be enough--to avoid the command of the Constitution. Over time, the public has become more accepting of the surveillance state. The Constitution remains a counter-majoritarian check on the government. Absent probable cause and a warrant, persistent aerial surveillance is an unreasonable search that violates the Fourth Amendment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

The paper analyses the disturbing trend that emerges from the similar placement of these nations with regards to the issue of privacy protection- one with the most robust, functional and detailed legislative framework and the other without any clear policy in place.

What is true is that panoptic spaces can be used as surreptitious instruments of examination, facilitating the omnipotent observer, but it is not the panoptic space that is evil, rather arguably the intent of an observer without conscience and a perverse mind that allows for it to occur. Electronic surveillance systems used in strategic architectural spaces are powerful instruments of observation positioned with the intent that they detect, prevent, and capture evidence of crime. Increasingly, however, surveillance appears to have little correlation to crime statistics, violence, or behavioural self-modification. This suggests that people in modern urban spaces have become desensitised to the constant observation that occurs in environments that are saturated with surveillance technology in much the same way as the over-use of signage in big cities over-stimulates the senses and becomes indistinct and redundant. Similarly, the overuse of overt surveillance makes the concept of behavioural self-modification fundamentally flawed, and, as such, these systems do little to support sustainable social behaviours that promote active and safe communities when our awareness of surveillance in the urban environment is diminished. This paper examines international examples of urban surveillance and argues that electronic surveillance technologies without a physical and respected authoritarian presence do not dissuade unwanted behaviours. Further, fear-mongering is designed to persuade society that increased surveillance is in the public interest to prevent crime. This paper suggests that the link that supports sustainable social behaviours and social engagement in urban contexts is well-considered design of urban spaces that specifically promote active communities. Many urban spaces, however, consider the placement and integration of surveillance devices as essential, and, where given prominence, this paper will provide commentary on such settings and circumstances where their existence becomes little more than staged environments designed to invade civil liberties and individual privacy.

One way governments try to meet this threat is with improved security technologies that keep track of terrorists’ movements and communications. But these same devices will also be monitoring innocent people, and so can threaten privacy and civil rights. Will less freedom be an unavoidable side effect of powerful new surveillance technologies? Not necessarily — but the time to start thinking about the impact of security technologies on democratic rights is during research and development (R&D), not after the devices have been introduced into society. Ji Sun Lee, a lawyer at the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in Washington DC, is trying to do just this. Up to four times a year, Lee convenes a 15-person ‘community acceptance of technology panel’ to gather feedback on the social implications of one of the DHS’s 140 technology projects. Panellists include experts in the social aspects of security and surveillance, as well as representatives of interest groups who might be particularly affected.'),

One possible means to evade surveillance is to avoid or opt-out of digital technologies, yet such acts of disconnection ignore the increasing degree to which the internet has become an essential infrastructure for people''s day-to-day lives. In this paper, I contend that users do not have to retreat from digital technologies to avoid surveillance by focusing on The Disconnect magazine as a digital technology that provides a disconnective experience. The Disconnect is a hybrid digital/offline magazine that forces its readers to disconnect their device from the internet to access the magazine content. Using Ulises AH Mejias'' theory of paranodality and a mix of the walkthrough method and a platform studies approach, I analyse The Disconnect as a paranodal or off-the-network technology that inoculates its readers from surveillance practices during the period of media consumption. By forcing its readers offline, I argue The Disconnect creates a quiet and unobservable space on the edge of the digital network that escapes the reach of cHent-side surveillance programs such as Google Analytics, that in turn enhances readers'' intellectual privacy and autonomy. Moreover, by fusing an offline experience with a digital medium, The Disconnect demonstrates that digital technologies are not synonymous with ubiquitous surveillance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

','Machine learning algorithms have reached mainstream status and are widely deployed in many applications. The accuracy of such algorithms depends significantly on the size of the underlying training dataset; in reality a small or medium sized organization often does not have the necessary data to train a reasonably accurate model. For such organizations, a realistic solution is to train their machine learning models based on their joint dataset (which is a union of the individual ones). Unfortunately, privacy concerns prevent them from straightforwardly doing so. While a number of privacy-preserving solutions exist for collaborating organizations to securely aggregate the parameters in the process of training the models, we are not aware of any work that provides a rational framework for the participants to precisely balance the privacy loss and accuracy gain in their collaboration.'),

This data can be analysed to identify precise trajectories of individuals — where they went and when they were there. This is an obvious privacy issue, yet publication of real-time aggregate over such location streams can provide valuable resources for researchers and government agencies, e.g., in case of pandemics it would be very useful to identify who might have come into contact with an infected individual at a given time. Differential privacy techniques have become popular and widely adopted to address privacy concerns. However, there are three key issues that limit the application of existing differential privacy approaches to user trajectory data: (a) the heterogeneous nature of the trajectories, (b) uniform sliding window mechanisms do not meet individual privacy requirements and (c) limited privacy budgets and impact on data utility when applied to infinite data streams. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a private real-time trajectory stream statistics publication mechanism utilizingdifferential privacy (DP-PSP). To relieve the heterogeneity issues, anchor point discovery (e.g., fixed locations like museums, parks, etc.) and road segmenting mechanisms are proposed. We provide an adaptive w-step sliding window approach that allows users to specify their own dynamic privacy budget distribution to optimize their own privacy budget. To preserve the data utility, we present multi-timestamp prediction models and private k-nearest neighbour selection and perturbation algorithms to reduce the amount of perturbation distortion induced through the differential privacy mechanism. Comprehensive experiments over real-life location-based social network user trajectories show that DP-PSP provides private data aggregate over infinite trajectory streams and boosts the utility and quality of the perturbed aggregation without compromising individual privacy'),

This is a challenge when designing tools and approaches for the use of Educational Big Data (EBD) and learning analytics (LA) in a global market. The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of information privacy in a cross-cultural setting to define a common point of reference for privacy engineering. Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows a conceptual exploration approach. Conceptual work on privacy in EBD and LA in China and the west is contrasted with the general discussion of privacy in a large corpus of literature and recent research. As much of the discourse on privacy has an American or European bias, intimate knowledge of Chinese education is used to test the concept of privacy and to drive the exploration of how information privacy is perceived in different cultural and educational settings. Findings: The findings indicate that there are problems using privacy concepts found in European and North-American theories to inform privacy engineering for a cross-cultural market in the era of Big Data. Theories based on individualism and ideas of control of private information do not capture current global digital practice. The paper discusses how a contextual and culture-aware understanding of privacy could be developed to inform privacy engineering without letting go of universally shared values. The paper concludes with questions that need further research to fully understand information privacy in education. Originality/value: As far as the authors know, this paper is the first attempt to discuss -- from a comparative and cross-cultural perspective -- information privacy in an educational context in the era of Big Data. The paper presents initial explorations of a problem that needs urgent attention if good intentions of privacy supportive educational technologies are to be turned into more than political slogans.'),

Other existing approaches that do not rely on a trusted third party assume that all collaborating devices are trusted. In particular, when inviting a new collaborator to a group, one needs to choose between a) keeping past edits private and sending only the latest state (a snapshot) of the document; or b) allowing the new collaborator to verify her view of the document is consistent with other honest devices by sending the full history of (signed) edits. We present a new protocol which allows an authenticated snapshot to be sent to new collaborators while both hiding the past editing history, and allowing them to verify consistency. We evaluate the costs of the protocol by emulating the editing history of 270 Wikipedia pages; 99% of insert operations were processed within 11.0 ms; 64.9 ms for delete operations. An additional benefit of authenticated snapshots is a median 84% reduction in the amount of data sent to a new collaborator compared to a basic protocol that transfers a full edit history.'),

The study used a confirmatory factor analysis to test the measurement model and a structural equation modeling approach to empirically validate the structural model. Findings: It was found that the benefit of information disclosure was the strongest predictor of value of disclosure and that value of disclosure and privacy concerns influenced consumers'' willingness to disclose biometric information.

Our previous work has proposed a privacy preservation solution that can effectively boost OSNs'' sociability while protecting users'' friendship privacy against attacks launched by individual malicious requestors. In this paper, we propose an advanced collusion attack, where a victim user''s friendship privacy can be compromised through a series of carefully designed queries coordinately launched by multiple malicious requestors. The effect of the proposed collusion attack is validated through synthetic and real-world social network data sets. The in-depth research on the advanced collusion attacks will help us design a more robust and secure friend search engine on OSNs in the near future.'),

Yet, the state of the art is based on heavily centralized services and platforms, where the service providers have full possession of the users’ location data. Recently, researchers have started addressing the challenge of enabling privacy-preserving ridesharing. The initial proposals, however, have shortcomings, as some rely on a central party, some incur high performance penalties, and most do not consider time preferences for ridesharing. TOPPool encompasses ridesharing based on the proximity of end-points of a ride as well as partial itinerary overlaps. To achieve the latter, we propose a simple yet powerful reduction to a private set intersection on trips represented as sets of consecutive road segments. We show that TOPPool includes time preferences while preserving privacy and without relying on a third party. We evaluate our approach on real-world data from the New York’s Taxi & Limousine Commission. Our experiments demonstrate that TOPPool is superior in performance over the prior work: our intersection-based itinerary matching runs in less than 0.3 seconds for reasonable trip length, in contrast, on the same set of trips prior work takes up to 10 hours.'),

Therefore, it is important for developers to consider individual user preferences and how they would change under varying circumstances, in order to identify actionable steps towards developing user trust and exercising privacy-preserving data practices. To help achieve this, we present the design and evaluation of machine learning models that predict (1) personalized allow/deny decisions for different information flows involving various attributes, purposes, and devices (AUC .868), (2) what circumstances may change original decisions (AUC .899), and (3) how much (US dollars) one may be willing to pay or receive in exchange for smart home privacy (RMSE 12.459).

In this method, the presence of a human being is determined by dividing an image into several regions and then calculating the heart rate detected in each region. In our performance evaluation, the proposed method showed dominant performance results when compared with an existing face detection method, and was confirmed to be an effective method for detecting faces in both normal and blurred images.

However, news reports continue to script headlines drawing attention to data improprieties, privacy breaches and identity theft. While data privacy is addressed in existing information system (IS) programs, greater emphasis on the significance of these privacy issues is required as big data technology advances. In response to this demand, some colleges and universities are developing big data programs and degrees (Gupta, Goul & Dinter, 2015). Yet not every university has the resources to allow for such expansion; some institutions struggle just to cover their IS core program courses. For these latter programs, awareness of the importance of privacy and privacy methods--like the application of security controls--is best integrated academically through a layered approach. Therefore, in this paper, the authors illustrate the important role that data privacy plays in the realm of big data, and suggest methods for providing a layered approach to applying big data privacy concepts to the IS2010 Model Core Curriculum.'),

We show that Continuity messages are broadcast over BLE in response to actions such as locking and unlocking a device’s screen, copying and pasting information, making and accepting phone calls, and tapping the screen while it is unlocked. Laboratory experiments reveal a significant flaw in the most recent versions of macOS that defeats BLE Media Access Control (MAC) address randomization entirely by causing the public MAC address to be broadcast. We demonstrate that the format and content of Continuity messages can be used to fingerprint the type and Operating System (OS) version of a device, as well as behaviorally profile users. Finally, we show that predictable sequence numbers in these frames can allow an adversary to track Apple devices across space and time, defeating existing anti-tracking techniques such as MAC address randomization.'),

Still, there are no accepted formal definitions of privacy goals, and ACNs often define their goals ad hoc. However, the formal definition of privacy goals benefits the understanding and comparison of different flavors of privacy and, as a result, the improvement of ACNs. In this paper, we work towards defining and comparing privacy goals by formalizing them as privacy notions and identifying their building blocks. For any pair of notions we prove whether one is strictly stronger, and, if so, which. Hence, we are able to present a complete hierarchy. Using this rigorous comparison between notions, we revise inconsistencies between the existing works and improve the understanding of privacy goals.'),

Proposed solutions such as Counter-RAPTOR [29] attempt to ameliorate this issue by favoring Tor entry relays that have high resilience to these attacks. However, because these defenses bias Tor path selection on the identity of the client, they invariably leak probabilistic information about client identities. In this work, we make the following contributions. First, we identify a novel means to quantify privacy leakage in guard selection algorithms using the metric of Max-Divergence. Max-Divergence ensures that probabilistic privacy loss is within strict bounds while also providing composability over time. Second, we utilize Max-Divergence and multiple notions of entropy to understand privacy loss in the worst-case for Counter-RAPTOR. Our worst-case analysis provides a fresh perspective to the field, as prior work such as Counter-RAPTOR only analyzed average case-privacy loss. Third, we propose modifications to Counter-RAPTOR that incorporate worst-case Max-Divergence in its design. Specifically, we utilize the exponential mechanism (a mechanism for differential privacy) to guarantee a worst-case bound on Max-Divergence/privacy loss. For the quality function used in the exponential mechanism, we show that a Monte-Carlo sampling-based method for stochastic optimization can be used to improve multi-dimensional trade-offs between security, privacy, and performance. Finally, we demonstrate that compared to Counter-RAPTOR, our approach achieves an 83% decrease in Max-Divergence after one guard selection and a 245% increase in worst-case Shannon entropy after 5 guard selections. Notably, experimental evaluations using the Shadow emulator shows that our approach provides these privacy benefits with minimal impact on system performance.'),

Specifically, Information Technology (IT) has led to a very vital innovation in health sector called electronic health (e-Health). In order to optimize full and excellent benefits of this innovation, its implementation in a cloud-based environment is important. However, with noticeable and numerous benefits inherent from e-Health in a cloud computing, its full utilization is still being hampered by challenges of security and privacy. In this paper, we focused on extensive review of current and existing literatures of various approaches and mechanisms being used to handle security and privacy related matters in e-Health. Strengths and weaknesses of some of these approaches were enunciated. The literature review was carried out after selecting over One Hundred and Ten (1 1 0) original articles and figured out several models adopted in their solutions. After comparing models used, we arrived at the reviewed articles. Reviewed articles were narrowed down to the current number because of similarity observed in the models adopted by some researchers. Also, we give an acceptable and standard definition of e-Health. Effort was made to classify cloud-based models. Security and privacy requirements as recommended by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) were also discussed and provided. Remarks and recommendations were made regarding the review process and future directions on security and privacy of e-Health in cloud computing was also provided. Finally, authors propose a secured and dependable architecture for electronic health that could guarantee efficiency, reliability and regulated access framework to health information.

Meanwhile, it also entails the risk of location privacy disclosure. To address this issue, general solutions introduce a single trusted anonymizer between the users and the location service provider (LSP). However, a single anonymizer offers limited privacy guarantees and incurs high communication overhead in continuous LBSs. Once the anonymizer is compromised, it may put the user information in jeopardy. In this paper, we propose a dual privacy preserving (DPP) scheme in continuous LBSs to protect the users’ trajectory and query privacy. Our scheme introduces multiple anonymizers between the users and LSP, and combines with Shamir threshold mechanism, dynamic pseudonym mechanism, and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${K}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-anonymity technology to improve the users’ trajectory and content privacy in continuous LBSs. An anonymizer alone cannot get the users’ trajectory and query contents, and it thus can be semi-trusted. Our scheme can enhance the users’ privacy and effectively solve the single point of failure in single anonymizer structure. At the same time, the query authentication can guarantee the correctness of the query results. The analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has the ability to protect users’ trajectory and content privacy effectively, and to reduce the computation and communication overhead of the single anonymizer.'),

Operators of DNS recursive resolvers—the machines that receive a client’s query for a domain name and resolve it to a corresponding IP address—can learn significant information about client activity. Past work, for example, indicates that DNS queries reveal information ranging from web browsing activity to the types of devices that a user has in their home. Recognizing the privacy vulnerabilities associated with DNS queries, various third parties have created alternate DNS services that obscure a user’s DNS queries from his or her Internet service provider. Yet, these systems merely transfer trust to a different third party. We argue that no single party ought to be able to associate DNS queries with a client IP address that issues those queries. To this end, we present Oblivious DNS (ODNS), which introduces an additional layer of obfuscation between clients and their queries. To do so, ODNS uses its own authoritative namespace; the authoritative servers for the ODNS namespace act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they receive, but they never see the IP addresses for the clients that initiated these queries. We present an initial deployment of ODNS; our experiments show that ODNS introduces minimal performance overhead, both for individual queries and for web page loads. We design ODNS to be compatible with existing DNS protocols and infrastructure, and we are actively working on an open standard with the IETF.'),

Surveillance caused privacy breaching incidents have already questioned existing personal data collection techniques. Organizations assemble a huge amount of personally identifiable information (PII) for data-driven market analysis and prediction. However, the limitation of data tracking tools restricts the detection of exact data breaching points. Blockchain technology, an ‘immutable’ distributed ledger, can be leveraged to establish a transparent data auditing platform. However, Art. 42 and Art. 25 of general data protection regulation (GDPR) demands ‘right to forget’ and ‘right to erase’ of personal information, which goes against the immutability of blockchain technology. This paper proposes a GDPR complied decentralized and trusted PII sharing and tracking scheme. Proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system (BcPIIMS) demonstrates data movement among GDPR entities (user, controller and processor). Considering GDPR limitations, BcPIIMS used off-the-chain data storing architecture. A prototype was created to validate the proposed architecture using multichain. The use of off-the-chain storage reduces individual block size. Additionally, private blockchain also limits personal data leaking by collecting fast approval from restricted peers. This study presents personal data sharing, deleting, modifying and tracking features to verify the privacy of proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system.'),

Face recognition (FR) has become increasingly significant in many computer vision applications. However, with the rapid deployment of FR, the privacy of face images has been a growing concern, especially when FR is performed in cloud platforms. Several privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) schemes have been proposed to outsource FR without divulging private information. However, most existing schemes are built by employing partially or fully homomorphic cryptosystems, which contain a series of computationally expensive operations and require interactions between users and service providers. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient scheme to achieve privacy-preserving face recognition in the cloud. Using randomness techniques, we propose an affine transformation, which consists of permutation, diffusion and shift transformations, to protect the privacy of faces. Both projection (feature extraction) and recognition procedures are performed in encrypted domain without interaction. We also propose an optimization technique to increase the efficiency of encryption. Extensive experimental analysis is performed to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Theoretical comparison is also conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.'),

A passive adversary, equipped with microphones, can leverage the ongoing sensing to infer private information about individuals. Further, with multiple microphones, a beamforming-capable adversary can defeat the previously-proposed privacy protection obfuscation techniques. Such an adversary can isolate the obfuscation signal and cancel it, even when situated behind a wall. AudioSentry is the first to address the privacy problem in audio sensing by protecting the users against a multi-microphone adversary. It utilizes the commodity and audio-capable devices, already available in the user’s environment, to form a distributed obfuscator array. AudioSentry packs a novel technique to carefully generate obfuscation beams in different directions, preventing the multi-microphone adversary from canceling the obfuscation signal. AudioSentry follows by a dynamic channel estimation scheme to preserve authorized sensing under obfuscation. AudioSentry offers the advantages of being practical to deploy and effective against an adversary with a large number of microphones.

To bridge this gap, we conducted a task-based study with 27 Android and iOS smart-phone users in order to learn about their perceptions, concerns and practices, and to understand the usability of these features with regards to privacy. We explored the following: users’ awareness of these features, why and when do they change the settings of these features, the challenges they face while configuring these features, and finally the mitigation strategies they adopt. Our findings reveal that users of both platforms have limited awareness of these features and their privacy implications. Awareness of these features does not imply that a user can easily locate and adjust them when needed. Furthermore, users attribute their failure to configure default features to hidden controls and insufficient knowledge on how to configure them. To cope with difficulties of finding controls, users employ various coping strategies, some of which are platform specific but most often applicable to both platforms. However, some of these coping strategies leave users vulnerable.'),

Due to privacy concerns, people may hesitate to share their locations and prohibit the growth of location-based services and analysis. The problem of protecting location privacy has been extensively studied in the literature. Sharing location data in sequence enable adversaries to apply privacy attacks by exploiting spatio-temporal constraints in road networks. In this paper, we identify a novel privacy attack that existing solutions cannot overcome for not considering upcoming sensitive locations in advance. We develop a technique to precompute the warning zone, i.e. the refined area where the disclosure of a user’s actual location may enable adversaries to identify the user’s sensitive locations in the future. Warning zones also enable users to reduce the frequency of not sharing locations for privacy reasons, and thereby improve the accuracy and utility of shared locations while guaranteeing the required level of location privacy of a user. Experiments using real datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art technique in terms of privacy, data utility and computational overhead.'),

Facial recognition, while providing new potentials fo r safety and security and personalized marketing by retailers implicates complicated questions about the nature of consumer privacy and surveillance where a "collection imperative '''' incentivize corporate actors to accumulate increasingly massive reservoirs of consumer data. However, the law has not yet fully developed to address the unique risks to consumers through the use of this technology. This Note examines existing regulatory mechanisms, finding that consumer sensitivities and the opaque nature of the technology have resulted in over- and underinclusive regulatory regimes. This Note proposes that the broad implications of biometric privacy harms justify more extensive privacy regulation than a narrow focus on data security and self-regulation. It suggests that regulation predicated on consumer data self-management is inefficient in controlling the flow of information generated by facial recognition. This Note finds that a regulatory approach based in collaborative governance may be better suited for regulating complex systems that create hard-to-calculate risks, change too quickly fo r traditional regulatory approaches, and involve technical and industry expertise that regulators and legislators are unlikely to have.'),

Nevertheless, mining concise crucial patterns is more promising than frequent patterns over data streams, since crucial patterns can avoid redundancy to reduce storage space and extract lossless information from frequent patterns. Nevertheless, mining crucial patterns from data streams which aggregate information from individuals is more likely to reveal privacy than static scenarios, because the background knowledge of the release at adjacent time instances can enhance the adversary''s inferential ability. This study points out the problems and principles of privacy leakage over mining crucial patterns in data streams, and proposes a differentially private crucial patterns mining algorithm which designs a two-phase mechanism at every timestamp. Specifically, the two-phase mechanism includes the dissimilarity calculation phase and the noise-mining phase, which considers not only the tradeoff between privacy and utility but also the tradeoff between mining time and maintenance cost. To improve data utility over successive releases in streams, the dissimilarity is computed to decide to return either low noisy statistic or accurately approximated statistic in the first phase. When the low noisy statistic needs to be turned, the algorithm goes into the noise-mining phase. In the noise-mining phase, crucial pattern candidate set with a judgment query set is firstly identified, and then random noise drawn from the Laplace distribution to their supports are added to obtain the noisy supports. Finally, strict theoretical analysis and extensive experiments are provided to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.'),

Within these services, location privacy issues have captured significant attention. Vehicles use the technology of anonymity to implement occultation, the location is not revealed. In this process, large-scale data transmissions can reduce the quality of services. In order to ensure location privacy and high-quality services, the cloud manager customizes virtual machines for vehicles to support location-based services according to the vehicles’ demands. To achieve better performance, this article presents a conditional anonymity method that does not use bilinear pairings to address the problem of privacy disclosure by using discrete logarithm problem and Diffie–Hellman problem. Moreover, asymmetric key algorithms are used in the Internet of vehicles environment to reduce the cost. To guarantee secure data transmission in Internet of vehicles, the batch validation technique is used to address data integrity. Our theoretical security analysis and experiments show that the proposed scheme is secure in compared attack models, such as impersonation attacks, replay attacks, the man-in-the-middle attacks, and so on. Our proposed scheme ensures the security requirements such as message authentication, location privacy protection, and traceability, while lowering transmission and computation cost.'),

At the same time, malicious users may send false data such that the control center makes a wrong power resource scheduling. In addition, efficiency issues should be taken into account in Internet of things applications. To overcome these challenges, an efficient and privacy-preserving certificateless data aggregation scheme is proposed for Internet of things–enabled smart grids. The confidentiality and integrity of data can be guaranteed, and the identity of users can be hidden in our scheme. In particular, if some users have malicious behaviors, they will be tracked. The proposed scheme can resist replay attacks, modification attacks, and impersonation attacks. In the process of collecting data, computation of encryption and signature generation do not need expensive bilinear pairings. Furthermore, batch verification is used to improve efficiency of verification. It is demonstrated that the security, privacy, and efficiency issues in smart grid are addressed based on security and performance analysis.'),

In 2015 and 2016, the Department of Justice awarded more than $40 million in funding for BWCs to law-enforcement agencies, and most major cities have adopted them or plan to in the coming years. However, there are a number of fundamental problems: BWCs raise important privacy concerns, but there is no coherent national policy governing their use, and local departments often have only remedial policies. Furthermore, recent studies have called into question whether BWCs actually reduce the use of force by police, and BWC programs entail high initial and continuing costs. The policies that the Tucson, Mesa, and Phoenix Police Departments currently use implicate serious privacy concerns and need to be addressed. Therefore, this Note proposes that police departments act prospectively: they should study the need to implement a BWC program, or the need to expand one, and flesh out detailed guidelines before equipping more officers. These policies should preserve the privacy of individuals and the public while increasing the accountability of police actions.'),

Our analysis reveals that the protocol design contains violations of privacy best practices through which a tracker can passively and uniquely identify clients across several connections. This tracking mechanisms can achieve reduced delays and bandwidth requirements compared to conventional browser fingerprinting or HTTP cookies. This allows them to be applied in resource- or time-constrained scenarios such as real-time biddings in online advertising. To validate this finding, we investigated browsers which enable QUIC by default, e.g., Google Chrome. Our results suggest that the analyzed browsers do not provide protective measures against tracking via QUIC. However, the introduced mechanisms reset during a browser restart, which clears the cached connection data and thus limits achievable tracking periods. To mitigate the identified privacy issues, we propose changes to QUIC’s protocol design, the operation of QUIC-enabled web servers, and browser implementations.'),

We show that, if the user pays using a cryptocurrency, trackers typically possess enough information about the purchase to uniquely identify the transaction on the blockchain, link it to the user’s cookie, and further to the user’s real identity. Our second attack shows that if the tracker is able to link two purchases of the same user to the blockchain in this manner, it can identify the user’s cluster of addresses and transactions on the blockchain, even if the user employs blockchain anonymity techniques such as CoinJoin. The attacks are passive and hence can be retroactively applied to past purchases. We discuss several mitigations, but none are perfect.'),

Finally, the privacy benefits and limitations of using DIDs are analysed, with the conclusion that DIDs significantly improve the users’ privacy when utilised properly.'),

Its simplicity and universality have fueled the unprecedented and lasting global success of the current Internet. Nonetheless, some limitations of IP have been emerging in recent years. Furthermore, starting in mid-1990s, the advent of mobility, wirelessness, and the Web substantially shifted Internet usage and communication paradigms. This accentuated long-term concerns about the current Internet architecture and prompted interest in alternative designs. The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has been one of the key supporters of efforts to design a set of candidate next-generation Internet architectures. As a prominent design requirement, NSF emphasized “security and privacy by design” in order to avoid the long and unhappy history of incremental patching and retrofitting that characterizes the current Internet architecture. To this end, as a result of a competitive process, four prominent research projects were funded by the NSF in 2010: nebula, named-data networking, MobilityFirst, and expressive Internet architecture. This paper provides a comprehensive and neutral analysis of salient security and privacy features (and issues) in these NSF-funded future Internet architectures. Prior surveys on future Internet architectures provide a limited, or even no, comparison on security and privacy features. In addition, this paper also compares the four candidate designs with the current IP-based architecture and discusses similarities, differences, and possible improvements.'),

Mobile application firms can collect granular and largely unregulated data about their consumers, and must make ethical decisions about how and whether to collect, store, and share these data. This paper conducts a discourse analysis of mobile application developer forums to discover when and how privacy conversations, as a representative of larger ethical debates, arise during development. It finds that online forums can be useful spaces for ethical deliberations, as developers use these spaces to define, discuss, and justify their values. It also discovers that ethical discussions in mobile development are prompted by work practices which vary considerably between iOS and Android, today''s two major mobile platforms. For educators, regulators, and managers interested in encouraging more ethical discussion and deliberation in mobile development, these work practices provide a valuable point of entry. But while the triggers for privacy conversations are quite different between platforms, ultimately the justifications for privacy are similar. Developers for both platforms use moral and cautionary tales, moral evaluation, and instrumental and technical rationalization to justify and legitimize privacy as a value in mobile development. Understanding these three forms of justification for privacy is useful to educators, regulators, and managers who wish to promote ethical practices in mobile development.

To support Intercloud, a trust evaluation framework among clouds and users is required. For trust evaluation, conventional protocols are typically based on a centralized architecture focusing on a one-way relationship. For Intercloud, the environment is highly dynamic and distributed, and relationships can be one-way or two-way (i.e., clouds provide services to each other). This paper presents a distributed trust evaluation protocol with privacy protection for Intercloud. The new contributions and innovative features are summarized below. First, feedback is protected by homomorphic encryption with verifiable secret sharing. Second, to cater to the dynamic nature of Intercloud, trust evaluation can be conducted in a distributed manner and is functional even when some of the parties are offline. Third, to facilitate customized trust evaluation, an innovative mechanism is used to store feedback, such that it can be processed flexibly while protecting feedback privacy. The protocol has been proved based on a formal security model. Simulations have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol. The results show that even when half of the clouds are malicious or offline, by choosing suitable operational parameters the protocol can still support effective trust evaluation with privacy protection.',NULL),

Data Matters: Training the AI 438 II. The Legal Challenges 443 and Hurdles of Using Big Data: The Threat of Discriminatory Outcomes and Privacy [...]
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI) are often described as technological breakthroughs that will completely transform our society and economy. AI systems have been implemented everywhere, from medicine, transportation, finance, art, to legal and social spheres, and even in weapons development. In many sectors, AI systems have already started making decisions previously made by humans. Promising as AI systems may be, they also pose urgent challenges to our everyday life. While much attention has concerned AI''s legal implications, the literature suffers from a lack of solutions that account for both legal and engineering practices and constraints. This leaves technology firms without guidelines and increases the risk of societal harm. It also means that policymakers and judges operate without a regulatory regime to turn to when addressing these novel and unpredictable outcomes. This Article tries to fill the void by focusing on data rather than on the software and programmers. It suggests a new model that stems from a recognition of the significant role that the data plays in the de velopment and functioning of AI systems. Data is the most important aspect of teaching AI systems to operate. AI algorithms begin with a massive preexisting dataset, which data providers use to train the system. But the data that AI systems ''swallow'' can be illegal, discriminatory, altered, unreliable, or simply incomplete. Thus, the more data fed to the AI systems, the higher the likelihood that they could produce biased, discriminatory decisions and violate privacy rights. The Article discusses how discrimination can arise, even inadvertently, from the operation of ''''trusted'''' and ''''objective'' ''AI systems. To address this problem, this Article proposes a new AI Data Transparency Model that focuses on disclosure of data rather than, as some scholars argue, focusing on the initial software program and programmers. The Model includes an auditing regime and a certification program, run either by a governmental body or, in the absence of such entity, by private institutions. This Model will encourage the industry to take proactive steps to ensure and publicize that datasets are trustworthy. The suggested Model includes a safe harbor, which incentivizes firms to implement transparency recommendations even without massive regulatory oversight. From an engineering point of view, the Model recognizes data providers and big data as the most important components in the process of creating, training and operating AI systems. Even more importantly, the Model is technologically feasible because data can be easily absorbed and kept by a technological tool. Further, this Model is also practically feasible because it follows already existing legal frameworks of data transparency, such as the ones being implemented by the FDA and the SEC. Improving transparency in data systems would result in less harmful AI systems, better protect societal rights and norms, and produce improved outcomes in this emerging field, especially for minority communities that often lack resources or representation to challenge AI systems. Increased transparency of the data used while developing, training or operating AI systems would mitigate and reduce these harms. Additionally, to better identify the risks of faulty data, industry players must conduct critical evaluations and audits of the data used to train AI systems; one way to incentivize this is a certification system to publicize good-faith efforts to reduce the possibility of discriminatory outcomes and privacy violations in AI systems. This Article strives to incentivize the creation of new standards, which the industry could implement from the genesis of AI systems to mitigate the possibility of harm, rather than post-hoc assignments of liability.',NULL),

In the early days of the telegraph, there was no legal protection afforded to the privacy of telegraphic communication, and seizures of telegraphic dispatches figured in major events of the nineteenth century in the United States. Attempts to protect the content of telegrams by defining a customer/operator “privilege” under common law were rejected by the courts, as were attempts to protect the confidentiality of telegraphic communications through an analogy with the postal service. Each attempt by the government and the courts to obtain access to private telegraphic communication revived a debate about the constitutionality of such actions, which ultimately led to a new interpretation of constitutional law, including a legal right to privacy.',NULL),

These location data owners have a good idea of where their users are most of the time. Other businesses also want to use this information for location analytics, such as finding the optimal location for a new branch. However, location data owners cannot share their data with other businesses, mainly due to privacy and legal concerns. In this paper, we propose privacy-preserving solutions in which location-based queries can be answered by data owners without sharing their data with other businesses and without accessing sensitive information such as the customer list of the businesses that send the query. We utilize a partially homomorphic cryptosystem as the building block of the proposed protocols. We prove the security of the protocols in semi-honest threat model. We also explain how to achieve differential privacy in the proposed protocols and discuss its impact on utility. We evaluate the performance of the protocols with real and synthetic datasets and show that the proposed solutions are highly practical. The proposed solutions will facilitate an effective sharing of sensitive data between entities and joint analytics in a wide range of applications without violating their customers’ privacy.',NULL),

It argues that Etzioni is correct in seeing the recent conflict between Apple and the FBI over cracking the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone as requiring that considerations of national security be balanced against the rights of those it might impact. There are nonetheless critical questions about one must still ask: whose rights are curbed, to what degree, and how does a society decide which side to favor? More attention needs to be paid to the privacy of other iPhone users and, importantly, the burden that hacking the phone might impose on Apple, either impairing its brand value or compromising its business potential. Finally, by asking ‘who judges the balance?’, it questions whether labeling Apple a poor citizen is premature, as they had only begun challenging the FBI’s judgment through the judicial process.',NULL),

This is perhaps understandable, given that privacy has been understood as a mere interest, whereas speech rights have been seen as more fundamental. I have argued elsewhere that the “mere interest” view of privacy is false. Privacy, properly defined, is a necessary condition for human well-being or flourishing. The opening section of this article will provide an overview of this theory. Next, after a few remarks on speech absolutism, privacy absolutism, and balancing theories, I will sketch several of the dominant argument strands that have been offered in support of presumptively weighty speech rights. While these arguments, taken together, establish that free speech is important, they do not support the view that speech should nearly always trump privacy. In final section I will present and defend a way to balance free speech and privacy claims.',NULL),

Journal of Business Ethics, 156(1), 123. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-017-3553-z','Recent scholarship in business ethics has revealed the importance of privacy expectations as they relate to implicit privacy norms and the business practices that may violate these expectations. Yet, it is unclear how and when businesses may violate these expectations, factors that form or influence privacy expectations, or whether or not expectations have in fact been violated by company actions. This article reports the findings of three studies exploring how and when the corporate dissemination of consumer data violates privacy expectations. The results indicate that consumer sentiment is more negative following intentional releases of sensitive consumer data, but the effect of data dissemination is more complex than that of company intentionality and data sensitivity alone. Companies can effectively set, and re-affirm, privacy expectations via consent procedures preceding and succeeding data dissemination notifications. Although implied consent has become more widely used in practice, we show how explicit consent outperforms implied consent in these regards. Importantly, this research provides process evidence that identifies perceived violation of privacy expectations as the underlying mechanism to explain the deleterious effects, on consumer sentiment, when company actions are misaligned with consumers’ privacy expectations. Ethical implications for companies collecting and disseminating consumer information are offered.',NULL),

Along with enhanced capability to identify meaningful patterns in large data sets, contemporary data science renders many classical models of privacy protection ineffective. Addressing these issues through privacysensitive design is insufficient because advanced data science is mutually exclusive with preserving privacy. The special privacy problem posed by data analysis has so far escaped even leading accounts of informational privacy. Here, I argue that accounts of privacy must include norms about information processing in addition to norms about information flow. Ultimately, users need the resources to control how and when personal information is processed and the knowledge to make information decisions about that control. While privacy is an insufficient design constraint, value-sensitive design around control and transparency can support privacy in the information age. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]',NULL),

The issues identified include diversity in the conception and meaning of Big Data in education, ontological, epistemological disparity, technical challenges, ethics and privacy, digital divide and digital dividend, lack of expertise and academic development opportunities to prepare educational researchers to leverage opportunities afforded by Big Data. The goal of this paper is to raise awareness on these issues and initiate a dialogue.

However, sharing data is complicated by important protections on the data (e.g., protections of privacy and intellectual property). The spectrum of options existing between data needing to be fully open access and data that simply cannot be shared at all is quite limited. This paper puts forth a generalized remote secure enclave as a socio-technical framework consisting of policies, human processes, and technologies that work hand in hand to enable controlled access and use of restricted data. Based on experience in implementing the enclave for computational, analytical access to a massive collection of in-copyright texts, we discuss the synergies and trade-offs that exist between software components and policy and process components in striking the right balance between safety for the data, ease of use, and efficiency.',NULL),

Abstract In the cloud computing environment, the privacy of the electronic data is a serious issue that requires special considerations. We have presented a state-of-the-art review of the methodologies and approaches that are currently being used to cope with the significant issue of privacy. We have categorized the privacy-preserving approaches into four categories, i.e., privacy by cryptography, privacy by probability, privacy by anonymization and privacy by ranking. Moreover, we have developed taxonomy of the techniques that have been used to preserve the privacy of the governing data. We also presented a comprehensive comparison of the privacy-preserving approaches from the angle of the privacy-preserving requirements’ satisfaction. Therefore, it is highly desirable that the mechanisms should be developed to deploy efficient auditing and accountability mechanisms that anonymously monitor the utilization of data records and track the provenance to ensure the confidentiality of the data.',NULL),
